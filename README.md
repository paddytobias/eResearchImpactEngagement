A project for the UNE eResearch Committee to find out what potential eResearch capabilities bring to the research engagement and impact, ahead of the 2018 ARC assessment. 

The project begun with building a webscraper to trawl the Impact Ref UK website and harvest nearly 1000 case studies submitted in 2014. Then wanted to undertake text mining of the case studies to identify eResearch potential, of which there is not much in terms of the frequency count (roughly 16-17 percent). Based on this result, there is a script here that subsets the total case studies to those with sentences containing an eResearch work (chosen from a simple lexicon that I created). With this subset we are able to see some *eResearc-associated* themes emerge. Thus the quesion became, of those case studies using an eResearch technology or approach, what tendencies do they have? 

The results have been presented at the UNE eResearch Committee. 

These scripts are written for my own use and won't work 'out of the box' for others. I am providing them so you can see the methodology.
