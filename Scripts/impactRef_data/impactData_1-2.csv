Our research results on bonded crack retarders have redirected industry development programmes on hybrid metal laminate material systems and been used to evaluate reinforced structural concepts for US Air Force wing and fuselage applications. Methods to assess and mitigate maintenance-induced damage have been developed and implemented based on our research. Our contour measurement technology has been transferred to the US Air Force, which now has the capability to perform measurements in-house and support work with both NASA and the US Navy. 1995-97: Edwards (Lecturer / Senior Lecturer) led MoD-funded research on the study of residual stresses by adapting the Sachs layer removal technique to research fatigue crack growth from cold-worked holes in airframes [3.1]. 2000-04: Edwards (Reader / Professor) and Fitzpatrick (Senior Lecturer / Reader; joined the OU 1995) worked on the assessment of welding techniques for the fabrication of aerospace structures as part of the EPSRC-funded WELDES programme, in collaboration with Airbus, Alcoa and QinetiQ. Weld residual stress measurement [3.2] and modelling [3.3] contributed to our understanding of long fatigue crack growth in both Metal Inert Gas (MIG) and Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welded aluminium, crack closure effects on stress intensity factors and the prediction of fatigue lifetime for skin-stringer panels. 2001-08: Edwards (Reader / Professor), Fitzpatrick (Senior Lecturer / Reader) and Gungor (Lecturer, joined the OU 2002) pioneered the application of the contour method [3.2] and validated the novel contour `rosette' method for the determination of the complete stress tensor in a component. This research used the contour method technique in conjunction with other approaches to provide accurate and, most importantly, validated measurements of the residual stresses that were used in models for the fatigue crack growth rates and damage tolerance of welded joints in aerospace aluminium alloys. Hybrid approaches to residual stress measurement using synchrotron X-rays for high spatial resolution were complemented by neutron measurements of strain in critical areas identified by full field contour measurements. 2006-09: Edwards (Professor; left the OU 2011) and Fitzpatrick (Reader) worked on the development of bonded crack retarders for the retardation of fatigue cracks in welded aerospace structures, funded by Airbus UK. Following earlier work on residual stresses in welded aircraft structures, bonded crack retarders were shown to be a powerful structural solution for improving damage tolerance in integral aircraft structures [3.4]. 2006-09: Fitzpatrick (Reader / Professor) studied the residual stresses around scribe mark damage in fuselage alloys following fatigue cracking in some airframes [3.5, 3.6], funded by Airbus. Nano-indentation, previously shown to be sensitive to residual stress, was validated by synchrotron X-rays for application to small-scale stress fields. 2009-13: Fitzpatrick (Professor) and Moffatt (Lecturer) modelled the life benefit and stability of bonded crack retarders for improved damage tolerance of new and existing airframes in partnership with Airbus. 2009 to present: Fitzpatrick (Professor) researched laser shock peening for damage repair and life enhancement of aerospace materials [3.6], funded by Airbus and the US Air Force, with support from Alcoa. Our research has informed the damage-tolerant design and lifing of aircraft structures in the presence of residual stresses and a recently-identified source of fatigue initiation caused during airframe maintenance. We have developed the contour method of residual stress measurement, since 2002, into a validated industrial tool for measuring residual stresses in complex engineering components, and integrated it with non-destructive stress measurement techniques capable of resolving fine spatial detail. We have applied our comprehensive toolkit of stress analysis techniques to aircraft structures in collaboration with the MoD, the US Air Force Research Laboratory, Airbus, BAE Systems, Bombardier, and Alcoa. In 2013 we set up a business unit at the OU providing a contour method measurement service for industry. Our research into the development, application and validation of the contour method is now enabling its uptake in industry: `The OU had the unique capability to measure large field residual   stresses with the accuracy and   repeatability required for safety critical structures. We were convinced   by the validation evidence   provided by their research that the contour technology was at a stage   suitable for transfer into   our work on airframes and associated components. ... As a direct result   of collaboration with   Professor Fitzpatrick and his staff, along with focused training and   technical support provided by   the research team at the OU, AFRL/RQ now has an organic means by which   to evaluate the   stress state of laser peened test coupons and structures. ... We are   currently using our on-site   contouring for several internal research programs and also to support   collaborative research with   both NASA and the US Navy.' [5.1]. Our research has also demonstrated accurate prediction of fatigue crack growth for damage tolerant design of integral forged structures that do not have the natural crack arrest characteristics of conventionally riveted designs. In particular, our research into the design of bonded crack retarders since 2005 through various projects for life enhancement of new and existing aircraft structures has enabled Alcoa to: `[establish] collaborations with producers of advanced fibers and   adhesive systems to evaluate   and develop material systems to further improve the design concepts   evaluated in past and   current collaborations with The Open University ... the results from the   bonded crack retarder   projects [have been implemented] in several United States Air Force   Research Laboratory   funded projects to evaluate selectively reinforced and hybrid laminate   aerospace structural   concepts for wing and fuselage application' [5.2]. `Research in two key areas has resulted in an improved understanding   of the mechanisms by   which adhesively bonded selective reinforcement may be exploited ...   Aided by The Open   University's contributions, Airbus has achieved TRL3 [Technology Readiness Level 3] for   bonded crack retarders applied to wing structures, and expects to   achieve TRL4 in mid-2014.   This represents a sizable investment to date, and has firmly established   selective reinforcement   as a candidate for aircraft wings.' [5.3]. Following the discovery of unanticipated fatigue cracks from maintenance-induced scribe marks in some airframes from the 1990s onwards, and an instruction from the regulator to investigate the problem, we developed a new method from 2006-9 to determine residual stress at a very small length-scale. `The OU group was able to supply us with detailed mapping of the   residual stress and hardening   associated with different types of scratch damage. Their work was a   significant advance in the   methodology that was available to us, and was distinctive because   although the determination of   the residual stress around such small-scale features is extremely   challenging, they provided   cross-validation of their measurements by developing the nanoindentation   method to determine   the scratch residual stresses, and compare the results with synchrotron   X-ray data. The overall   work programme revealed the complexity of the interaction of the   hardening from the tool and   the residual stress generated. ... A key outcome was that this work   informed the conclusion by   the regulator to base the accept-or-repair decision on scratch depth   criteria.' [5.4]. The scribe marks work led to the investigation from 2008 of laser shock peening as a possible repair strategy (now patented by Airbus) which has now broadened to a programme looking at laser peening for life enhancement and improved damage tolerance. `We funded the OU to study residual stress generation from laser shock   peening as a candidate   technique [for repair]. An early result caused us to change the   direction of the programme   rapidly. The OU mapping of the laser peen stress field at much higher   spatial resolution than we   had ever seen previously led us to investigate different peen methods   from different providers.   Again, the OU's use of multiple, cross-validated techniques, was vital,   particularly when the data   generated contradicted that provided by the OEMs! The OU's work on the   contour method of   stress measurement, and the research to extend the method to new   capability for measuring   near-surface stresses, was very important to underpin this work. `A key outcome to-date of this work is that the laser peen technology   has formally progressed   through the Airbus Technology Readiness Level review system, with the OU   making a direct   input to that process.'

These projects have made innovative applied use of a substantial body of research into modern British and Irish religious history conducted in the Unit. This activity has: British religious history since c.1800 has long been a key focus of research in the Unit. In the mid-1990s, work by Beckerlegge, Wolffe, Gerald Parsons (senior lecturer until 2012) and Terence Thomas (senior lecturer until 1996) pioneered the documentation and analysis of the growth of religious diversity in Britain after the Second World War, setting recent trends in the longer-term historical perspective of developments since the Victorian era. Subsequent important contributions were made by Susan Mumm (lecturer/senior lecturer 1996-2006), with her work on Anglican sisterhoods, and David Herbert (lecturer/senior lecturer 1996-2009), with his research on secularisation theory and on media representations of the Northern Ireland conflict. Wolffe has been particularly active in this field. He published substantial monographs on aspects of British and Irish religious identities in 1994 and 2000, and edited texts and analysis of the 1851 Census of Religious Worship between 2000 and 2005. There is also extensive British and Irish material in his 2006 and 2012 books on international evangelicalism. Maiden, who joined the department as a research associate in 2009, has published a monograph on the 1927/28 prayer book crisis, and has since developed these research themes in work on evangelicalism and anti-Catholicism in the 1960s and 1970s. During recent years, Wolffe has focused his attention on London and to Northern Ireland. His work on London includes a substantial contribution to the prize-winning 1400th anniversary history of St Paul's Cathedral (2004), a co-authored analysis of the resurgence of the Church of England in the capital since 1980 (2012), and a case study of the relationship between the building of physical churches and the development of congregations in Victorian Finchley (2013). He has approached Northern Ireland through the comparative historical framework suggested by his earlier work on British and American anti-Catholicism, resulting in an edited book with a substantial sole-authored introduction and conclusion (2013) that explores long-term trajectories since the Reformation. In collaboration with the Belfast-based Institute for Conflict Research (ICR), he has been investigating recent and present-day attitudes in Northern Ireland, exploring how these are illuminated by an historical perspective and seeking to identify potential strategies to assist in conflict resolution, both in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Initial outcomes from this work are reported in John Bell, For God, Ulster and   Ireland? Religion Identity and Security in Northern Ireland, Belfast: ICR, 2013. The key insights from this body of work are Outputs Grants Nov 2008-Oct 2011: £233,547 awarded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to John Wolffe, for a project entitled `Modern Religious History and the Contemporary Church'. Oct 2009-March 2013: £349,000, awarded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to John Wolffe, for a project entitled `Protestant-Catholic Conflict: Historical Perspectives and Contemporary Realities'. Feb 2012-Jan 2013: £95,071 awarded by the AHRC to John Wolffe, for a project entitled `Building on History: Religion in London'. Central to maximising impact has been Wolffe's AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship, `Modern Religious History and the Contemporary Church' (working title, `Building on History'), in partnership with Kings College London, the Church of England Diocese of London and Lambeth Palace Library. The primary initial aim was to work alongside the main stakeholder, the Diocese of London, to: The `Building on History' project engaged with its stakeholders and the wider user community in a variety of ways. The success of the project partnership with the Diocese of London formed the basis for wider engagement with other faith constituencies in London. This engagement developed in a subsequent Open University- and AHRC-funded follow-on project, `Building on History: Religion in London', in collaboration with Royal Holloway University of London and a range of practitioner stakeholders. A series of ten events involving Baptists, Black Majority Churches, Jews, Methodists, Muslims and Roman Catholics was held in late 2012 and early 2013. Attendance averaged approximately 40, with at least 200 individuals attending on at least one occasion. Accompanying resources were provided on the website. Very positive feedback was received. For example, Dr Jamil Sherif (Muslim Council of Britain) judges that the project `really brought people together', raised the profile of history and has stimulated a more positive attitude to record-keeping among Muslims in London. Dr Tim Powell (National Archives) regards this project as `a very important strand in the delivery of the religious archives support plan'. There was also significant engagement with schools: Mr Marlon Chetty (The Urswick School, Hackney) considers the impact on his students (from two workshops in the autumn term 2012) to have been `really profound'. Examples of pilot teaching material have been made publicly available on the website. The programme for Wolffe's `Protestant-Catholic Conflict' project included, in 2012, a series of seminars with users and stakeholders in Belfast, Birmingham, Liverpool, London and Milton Keynes. The final project conference in Belfast attracted numerous non-academic delegates. Participants at the seminars and conference included religious leaders, senior civil servants, police officers and key representatives of non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations. There was enthusiastic affirmation of the value of the research, especially in adding to understanding of the religious dimensions of societal division in Northern Ireland, and the long-term context of politico-religious tensions in Britain through informed comparison between historic anti-Catholicism and contemporary Islamophobia."

The research has provided evidence for charities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) seeking to shape government legislation, initiate action on age-friendly environments, and to change care practice. As a result it has helped inform the UK's Equality Act 2010, new guidance on toilets in public spaces, user-friendly extra-care housing and an exemplary training programme on end-of-life care in care homes. The research behind these impacts relates to seven projects undertaken by members of the OU's Centre for Ageing and Biographical Studies (CABS), founded in 1995. Everyday ageism was the central concern of the `Research on Age Discrimination' (RoAD) project (2004-07) led by Bytheway (Consultant, Senior Research Fellow, 1991-2009) with Peace (Senior Lecturer, Professor), Holland (Research Fellow) and Ward (Research Assistant). Help the Aged (now Age UK) initiated this collaborative project with the OU in 2003 to engage older people in participatory research, including online networking, diary keeping and — significantly — training older co-researchers to interview others about daily experiences of ageism. The UK-wide findings identified discrimination in public places, health service delivery, the marketplace, appearance and fashion, sexuality and sexual orientation [3.1,5.1-5.4]. Three of the projects dealt with particular concerns of ageing and the environment namely planning, housing and design. `Social interaction in urban public places' (2005-07) funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) was led by Peace who was Principal Investigator (PI) with Holland, Katz (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer) and Clark (Research Assistant). The geographical focus was the town of Aylesbury, Bucks, where trained co-researchers spent a year observing how different generations shared, contested and avoided public spaces. These observations led to recommendations that facilitate age-friendly communities through using public resources to create accessible public toilets and appropriate street furniture [3.2,5.5]. Ageing or `staying' in place was also central to the second study, `Attitudes of Jewish people regarding extra-care housing' (2005-06) led by Katz (PI) and Holland [3.3,5.6]. This used focus group discussions on the topics of accommodation and care, the need for support and the importance of personal space within the physical environment. Building on this work, Holland and Peace acted as consultants for Silverville, a television programme by the BBC about daily life in extra-care housing. The third project, `Transitions in kitchen living' formed part of the UK Research Councils' New Dynamics of Ageing programme, and considered the effect of contemporary kitchen design upon older people living in both supportive and normal domestic housing, alongside related experiences of kitchens from the past and the possible role of future assistive technology (2009-12). For this work, Peace (PI), Percival (Research Assistant) and Scicluna (PhD student) collaborated with colleagues at Loughborough University's Design School. Their findings show how personal mobility, reach, dexterity, vision and hearing are all impacted upon by poor design, and how kitchens can be made to enhance personal well-being [5.7]. Finally, three connected projects, all funded by the Department of Health, were concerned with end-of-life care: `Death and dying in residential homes for older people', 'Investigating the training of staff' and `Developing training materials' (1995-2002). These featured Katz (PI), Sidell (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer to 2003) and Komaromy (Research Assistant, Lecturer, Senior Lecturer) [3.4,3.5,5.7-9]. Involving a phased national study of one hundred care homes, the research demonstrated how care staff need to recognise and put into practice end-of-life care for frail older people, acknowledging the importance of their personal needs and wider relationships. The findings have since formed the basis of important training materials. This body of work has had substantial impact, influencing policy and practice in the areas of age discrimination, design and end-of-life care. Impact on policy (i) The RoAD research was influential in the joint response given by Help the Aged/Age Concern, (now Age UK), first to the National Equality Panel, part of the UK Discrimination Law Review (2007/08), and second in evidence submitted to the UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights (2008/09). The case studies and findings from the research also formed the evidence base for Help the Aged's `Just Equal Treatment' campaign, which won a Third Sector Excellence Award in 2008 and was cited by the judging panel as `an outstanding example of persistently promoting matters of social justice to MPs and ministers and persuading them to change the law'. During the process of bringing forward the Equalities Bill (2008), now the Equalities Act (2010), Harriet Harman MP (then Secretary of State for Equalities) referred to the campaign as `evidence that has made it imperative for us to act' [5.1 - 5.4]. (ii) In October 2008, JRF gave documentary evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee entitled The Provision of Public Toilets. This cited The Open University's research into the location and design of toilets and the anxiety of some older people about encountering anti-social behaviour in such public spaces. As a result of the JRF evidence, the subsequent parliamentary report recommended that `local authorities can and should exercise existing legislative powers to prevent anti-social behaviour', and that `local authorities study the benefits and cost effectiveness of providing attended public toilets, or at least ensuring regular inspections, so that the public regains its confidence in using them' [5.5]. Impact on practice (iii) When central government funding became available for the development of extra-care housing in England, local decision makers in the Jewish community were presented with the question of how to address cultural and age-friendly issues. While participants wished to live in locations close to Jewish facilities such as the synagogue, the direct influence of Katz and Holland's research can be seen in the design of a care facility by Jewish Care, which provides enhanced space standards, even within two bedroom units, making a highly positive impact upon the lives of older people and establishing a model for future design [5.6]. (iv) The capacity to influence both the setting and the design of living environments for older people is clearly evident in the ongoing outcomes of the `Transitions in Kitchen Living (TiKL)' study. Peace and Maguire were invited to address the British Standards Institution's B/559 Access to Buildings for Disabled People Committee, in February 2012, during its period of consultation for new guidance [5.7]. The chartered architects practice, Archadia, have used the TiKL research when developing kitchen design in supported housing for the Almshouse Associations. Renee Mascari, Chief Executive of the Kitchens Bedrooms Bathrooms National Training Group (good practice training for the construction industry) following a feature on BBC's `You and Yours' has told us that: `I support all you said ... and as someone who has designed kitchens for nearly forty years as well as someone who teaches the principles of kitchen design, I continually promote all efforts to support inclusive design' (5.8, email 27 April 2013). (v) Our research on end-of-life care for people living in nursing homes led to the development of facilitated learning for those who work with older people in care homes. Training packs on palliative care and bereavement were developed in collaboration with Macmillan Cancer Support, and since 2011 there have been two print runs with over 8000 packs being distributed to hundreds of UK care homes. Adrienne Betteley, Palliative and End of Life Care Programme Manager at Macmillan, has told us that, `some of the positive comments from the facilitators were about the ways in which the care home staff were really improving their skills, knowledge and confidence; and it was really starting to change culture within the care home sector' http://www.open.ac.uk/health-and-social-care/main/research/research-themes/death-dying-and-bereavement. These palliative care materials are used to support the national Gold Standards Framework for care homes, a national training programme started in 2004 and supported by the four major trade associations in this sector [5.9 and 5.10]. A group of seven homes in Midlothian, Scotland reported that as a result of using the Macmillan/OU materials `There was a significant improvement in the following areas: care of the dying, control of symptoms, continuity of care, carer support (families) and continued learning' (Hockley et al., 2008, p. 4).

Dr Hoekstra's autism research is multidisciplinary, with topics ranging      from assessing the genetic and environmental influences on autism and      autistic traits to exploring cognitive phenotypes of autism to studying      autism in Ethiopia. Her twin, family and questionnaire development studies      link the variability in genetic and environmental processes with cognitive      and behavioural outcomes in autism, leading to a better understanding of      the heterogeneity inherent within the autism spectrum.

Title: Refining the autism phenotype: parent and twin studies of the      Autism-Spectrum Quotient and cognitive endophenotypes. PI: Hoekstra, R.A. Hoekstra's autism research is making an impact on several levels: Clinical impact and impact on families affected by autism The Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) is an instrument to assess autistic      traits, both in the research context and in the clinic. According to the      Dutch national psychiatry consortium for autism spectrum disorders in      adults [5.1], the Dutch translation of the AQ (validated by Hoekstra et      al., [3.2]) is the most commonly used instrument in clinical practice to      aid autism spectrum diagnoses in adults in the Netherlands. The British National Collaborative Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH)      developed the UK NICE guidelines for autism spectrum disorders in adults      simultaneously and in collaboration with the team devising the      multidisciplinary guidelines for the Netherlands. The Dutch guidelines      recommend using Hoekstra's Dutch translation of the AQ as a case      identification instrument [5.2]. Apart from the paper and pencil version,      the Dutch AQ is now also included as a digital test application and even      though the digital application only started recently, it has been used 34      times by 22 different institutions over one month (July 2013) [5.3]. The international impact of Hoekstra's research is further evidenced      through her development, in collaboration with Ethiopian psychiatrists and      mental health experts, of mental health education materials for the HEAT      programme in Ethiopia [5.4]. A first cohort of 1,367 health extension      workers started studying these materials in 2010/2011, a further 20,000      students are expected to enrol in the programme. The first 204 students      graduated in 2012; Hoekstra and colleagues evaluated the mental health      study sessions of HEAT in this first cohort of graduated students, and      compared their knowledge, attitudes and skills with health workers who had      not yet received training. The first findings of the study with      HEAT-trained health workers showed less stigmatising attitudes and      incorrect beliefs regarding the causes and treatment of autism. Based on      the findings from this study, the research team produced additional      training materials comprising five videos showing how to conduct a      clinical interview with parents of a child with intellectual disability or      autism, and a mental health pocket guide with dedicated sections on child      mental health including autism and intellectual disability. The Ethiopian      Federal Ministry of Health has formally approved these study materials and      intends to distribute the pocket guide to all 39,000 health extension      workers in the country. All study sessions and training materials are free      and openly available online, with the potential for re-use in other      under-resourced countries. Hoekstra is included in the World Health      Organisation's global autism network. In 2013 she presented the first      project findings at an autism consultation organised by the World Health      Organisation and Autism Speaks [5.5]. Public engagement Research advances made by Hoekstra informed her book, The Autism        Spectrum in the 21st Century: Exploring Psychology, Biology and Practice,      co-authored with Drs Ilona Roth, Chris Barson, Greg Pasco and Terry      Whatson [5.6]. The book is seen as `a must-have manual' of      `extraordinarily good value' [5.7]. Parents of children with autism have      commented on how helpful they have found the book: (i) `every parent      should be given this book upon receiving such a devastating diagnosis, as      although my son was diagnosed more than a year ago, and despite reading      much on the internet, I have learnt so much more from the book. ...' (ii)      `I find it [a] very good summary ... and [the book] actually helped me to      adjust the course of actions in ... helping my son.' Hoekstra's research also features on The Open University's OpenLearn      website, for which she and colleagues Ilona Roth and Mark Hirst produced      the following materials: Altogether, these autism-related educational pages have attracted over      62,000 unique visitors in the period between April 2011 and July 2013. The      `Unzip your genes' page has attracted more than 37,800 unique visitors      since April 2011; and more than 20,000 people have completed the Unzip      your genes quiz. The `Unzip your genes' page includes not only a quiz, but      also two animated videos explaining 'what is meant by genetic difference'      and 'what are twin studies'.

The research has also been translated for wider consumption in pivotal publications such as Grove Music Online, which features new entries on bands and individual brass instruments. The research also inspired Music in Words, the seminal textbook for teachers and students of music performance outside the higher education sector. Research on brass instruments carried out by Professor Herbert is regarded as pivotal. It is built on scholarly investigation and on his experience of performance with most major UK orchestras, opera companies, chamber ensembles and period instrument groups. The research is unique because it has been directed at key questions concerning the way brass instruments have been understood and used over a wide chronological period. Through a series of projects since 2003 the research has sought to enhance the music community's understanding of repertoires that include brass instruments even where the notated music does not indicate their use, how performance techniques and conventions have changed, and how historic brass instruments designs have impacted on the sound balance of ensembles more generally. The research has ranged from sixteenth-century court music to Victorian amateur brass bands, early New Orleans jazz and the avant-garde. A sustained theme of the work has been an exploration of the way the musical practices of the lower social orders have informed more elite musical repertoires and performance styles. The work has a particular distinctiveness because the point of departure has usually been a minute examination of the experiences of performers rather than the more usual starting point of examining written repertoires. In The British Brass   Band: A Musical and Social History [3.3] Herbert explained for the first time how such bands originated, how and what they played, and how the new virtuosity of amateurs influenced the writing of modernist composers. In other publications, but especially in his book The Trombone [3.4], Herbert (Professor in Music) explained the origin of the trombone in the fifteenth century, how and in what circumstances it was used by trombone players in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (a period when players of the instrument were ubiquitous but it was almost invisible in musical sources), and what the repertoire was. The book then explained the role of the valve trombone in orchestral music and jazz in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, giving new insights into the circumstances in which these instruments should be properly deployed. Ideas about the accurate deployment of instruments and performance techniques are the source of the most significant impact of the research. Perhaps the most vivid example is the Cyfarthfa project [3.1], in which Professor Herbert discovered, reconstructed and recorded the repertoire of a mid-nineteenth century brass band, using period instruments and the handwritten scores from which the original performers played. The project was the subject of a much-repeated BBC TV documentary (Mr Crawshay's Private Band). More recently, under the auspices of the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), Herbert has applied similar research questions to military music in the long nineteenth century (c.1770-1911), revealing key relationships between military music and musical practices more generally in Britain and the Empire. Each of these projects has implicitly and explicitly exemplified links between scholarly research and musical performance in the modern world. It was precisely because of this that the world's largest music performance examination organisation (the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM)) commissioned Herbert to write Music in Words: A Guide   to Researching and Writing About Music [3.6], which is now widely used by performing musicians and teachers throughout the world. Grants 1998: £4,280 awarded by the British Academy to Professor Herbert for a project entitled `Brass instruments and performance: social context and performance practice between 1820 and 1930' 2002-04: £53,635 awarded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board to Professor Herbert for a project entitled `A musical and cultural history of the trombone' (Graded `Outstanding') 2005-08: £77,514 awarded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council to Professor Herbert for a project entitled `Cultures of performance among British brass players 1750-1965' (Graded `Outstanding') 2008: £2,450 awarded by the British Academy to Professor Herbert for a project entitled `The place of brass instruments in the development of jazz idiom' (Satisfactory — the only positive grade used by the British   Academy) 2009-12: £256,000 from the Arts and Humanities Research Council to Professor Herbert for a project entitled `Military sponsorship of music in Britain in the nineteenth century and its relationship with the musical mainstream' (Grading not completed at the time of submission) Professor Herbert's research has decisively influenced professional and amateur musicians, the heritage industry, and print and broadcast media around the world. It has provided a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the conventions of historical performance of brass instruments than previously existed, and that knowledge continues to inspire new forms of artistic expression in modern performance. Herbert's long and distinguished career as a performer at the highest level of the music profession has provided him with an intimacy with the practical problems that performers face in interpreting musical texts and a familiarity with many of the world's leading players and ensembles. A great deal of the advice he provides is to individual performers: for example, he has advised members of the Welsh National Opera, the Royal Opera House and Glyndebourne Opera on the instruments that should be used for the performance of nineteenth-century Italian opera — particularly the type of instruments that should be used: valve or slide instruments; wide or narrow bore instruments and the type of instrument that should be properly deployed for the bass parts labelled `cimbasso'. He has also advised museums, including the National Museum of Wales, on the provenance and description of instruments. His advice is seen as important because it is known to be based on a forensic examination of a wide range of primary sources [5.10]. The depth of influence on the international music community of Professor Herbert's portfolio of research and its relevance to musical practice is perhaps best demonstrated in the continued success of Music in Words:   A Guide to Researching and Writing About Music. This was commissioned by the ABRSM (the world's largest music performance examining body) and first published in 2001. It is the default text for teachers of music performance and performance students, and is aimed at creating a strong synergy between research method and musical practice. Published in two editions (2001 and 2012) with associated websites, Music        in Words has been reprinted six times with 14,429 copies sold in Europe and Commonwealth countries. In 2010 it was adapted to American style and published in the USA by Oxford University Press (US sales data not available). Music in Words is praised by industry experts as `the standard reference work for all serious writers about music' (The   Trombonist), `an accessible and thorough source of guidance' (Ensemble),      and `an invaluable reference tool' (The Strad) [5.1, 5.2). Herbert's research has also contributed significantly to the most widely consulted reference sources in the world, which are commonly used as the initial reference points not just for academics but for the creative industries globally. These include Oxford Bibliographies Online (2011), The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (2008), the New        Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (continuously updated since 2000), American Grove and the New Grove Dictionary of Musical   Instruments (both 2012). Research findings have directly informed these publications, replacing longer established major entries with entirely new explanations of many of the fundamental search terms relating to brass instruments. From 2010 to 2013, annual hits on these brass instrument entries in Grove Music Online exceed 3000. Beyond the international music community, TV and radio programmes, commercial DVDs and heritage exhibitions have introduced Herbert's research to a wider public audience. These include major roles in radio series such as the American Public Radio Network Programme British   Brass Bands: A Working class Tradition (2013) and the documentary DVD History of Brass Bands: The Golden Period (2011). Permanent exhibitions for which Herbert has provided the explanatory texts and expert advice include the popular music culture exhibit at the National Waterfront Museum of Wales and the permanent exhibition at the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum, which typically attracts 70k-75k visitors each year (72,686 in 2012). This exhibit tells the story of the Cyfarthfa Band through a sequence of explanatory captions relating to instruments, music manuscripts, pictures and ephemera. It has in turn been the focus for several TV and radio programmes, including The People's Museum (BBC2, 2008)."

Wetlands, and peatlands in particular, are among the largest surface      reservoirs of carbon and      the single largest source of methane to the atmosphere. Research by Dr      Gauci and the      Ecosystems Research Group has focused on human influences over the      stability of carbon      within temperate and tropical peatlands that have been subject to human      interference      (principally through drainage) and on the influence of human activity such      as pollution, climate      warming and CO2 enrichment on wetland methane emissions. The      group has been influential in      identifying that the deposition of pollution-derived sulfate in acid rain      dramatically reduces      emission of the powerful greenhouse gas methane (Gauci et al.,      2002) and that this `sulfate      suppression' of methane emissions may have been sufficient to offset      climate-driven growth in      the global wetland methane emission source into the middle of this century      (Gauci et al., 2004).      Critically, and given the reduction of sulfur pollution in industrialised      nations, the group has      identified the long-lived duration of the sulfate-suppression effect, i.e.      that recovery from      methane suppression by sulfate deposition may take several decades (Gauci      et al., 2005). This      is supported by research into the responses of wetland methane emissions      to individual high      sulfur emission events in history, such as the Icelandic Laki eruption of      1783-84 (Gauci et al.,      2008). The work of Gauci and the Ecosystems Group has also extended to      understanding other forms      of carbon exchange within wetland ecosystems. Their recent work has      focused on variations in      carbon losses of peatlands into rivers, caused by deforestation, drainage      and fires in Bornean      peat swamps. These deposits are a particularly large reserve of carbon,      and the Open      University research demonstrated that these ecosystems are undergoing      instability and collapse      as a consequence of deforestation and land use change (Moore et al.,      2013). This was the first      such study to report fluvial carbon losses from forested as well as      deforested catchments, and      was the first to identify the age of the carbon that was lost. The group      found that the carbon lost      from forested ecosystems is modern and as such is tightly coupled to      current net primary      productivity. In contrast, the carbon lost from deforested and drained      peats was often thousands      of years old, in other words derived from the deep and ancient peat      reserves. Notably, the      oldest carbon lost originated in peatlands that had been converted to oil      palm agriculture. The      work was led by Gauci, who was senior and corresponding author on the      paper. Relevant grants: 2012-15 £597,425 awarded by NERC to Gauci for a project entitled `The      contribution of trees      to tropical wetland methane emissions' (total ~£750k to all partners —      Universities of      Bristol, Leicester and Nottingham). 2011-15 £157,170 awarded by Defra to Gauci for a project entitled `Lowland      peatland      systems in England and Wales — evaluating greenhouse gas fluxes and carbon      balances', competition code CTE1103 (total grant value: £1,750,783). 2010-14 £184,543 awarded by Defra to Gauci for a project entitled      `Investigation of peatland      restoration (grip blocking) techniques to achieve best outcomes for      methane and      greenhouse gas emissions / balance', competition code: CTE0945      (total grant      value: £1,065,519). 2010-14 £306,512 awarded by NERC Network to Gauci for a project entitled      `MethaneNet'. 2009 £69,624 awarded by NERC to Gauci for a project entitled `Urgency:      Quantifying      fluvial carbon losses following the catastrophic 2009 peat swamp forest      fires of      Kalimantan, Borneo'. 2007-09 £23,347 awarded by The Wildlife Trusts and EEDA to Gauci as PI      and consultant      for a project entitled `Carbon balance and C offset potential of the Great      Fen      Project'. 2007-10 £21,008 awarded by NERC to Gauci for a project entitled      `Dissolved organic carbon      losses from natural and degraded tropical peatlands'. The impact of work by Dr Gauci and the Ecosystems Group has influenced      several groups of      policymakers and users, often by direct interaction and targeted research. The research of Gauci and the Ecosystems Group demonstrated that acid      rain pollution      suppresses methane emissions from wetlands, and was featured in a US      Environmental Protection      Agency Report to Congress (Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions From      Natural Sources. United      States Environmental Protection Agency Report: Office of Atmospheric      Programs (6207J) EPA      430-R-10-001, Washington, DC 20460 April 2010). This led Defra to      investigate the potential role      of sulfur pollution in mitigating emissions from restored UK peatlands.      The economic potential of      understanding peatland carbon dynamics and the role of sulfate in      mitigating emissions has been      recognised by the Great Fen Project, which is taking the carbon balance      and offsetting of a great      swathe of the Cambridgeshire Fens into account in its future plans      (http://www.greatfen.org.uk/about/studies).      The work helped the Great Fen Project to recognise      that while its `re-wetting' conservation restoration strategy arrests      carbon loss by reducing carbon      oxidation, the high sulfate concentrations that exist within the fen peats      means that there are likely      to be lower methane emissions than could normally be expected to occur as      a consequence of      elevating the water-table. The work was influential in planning the      purchase of much of the area for      conservation, in part through marketing the scheme's carbon offsetting      potential and avoid carbon      losses. Gauci and the Ecosystems Group's work on the fluvial carbon losses of      pristine and degraded      tropical forested peatlands in Borneo feeds directly into the IPCC      (Intergovernmental Panel on      Climate Change) and REDD (UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and      Forest Degradation      programme) processes, since they have provided the only currently      available data on dissolved      organic carbon (DOC) exchanges for such ecosystems. This understanding of      the carbon      dynamics of the ecosystems is essential in subjects covered by protocols      such as REDD, including      carbon offsetting, avoided carbon losses and mitigation of carbon losses,      because dissolved      organic carbon is the single largest carbon fraction lost from these      ecosystems via river drainage. The Open University-led study was discussed in detail at three IPCC      workshops in Brazil,      Tanzania and Japan and is central for establishing the baseline for      natural DOC losses within the      IPCC Wetlands Supplement and for identifying a scaling factor for DOC      losses from drained      tropical peatlands. Annette Freibauer (one of the Coordinating Lead      Authors of Chapter 2 `Drained      Inland Organic Soils' of the 2013 Supplement to 2006 IPCC Guidelines for      National Greenhouse      Inventories: Wetlands), points out that the work: `has been a very important scientific source in the development of      methodologies and      emission factors for DOC for drained and rewetted organic soils. The paper      has been quoted      in the scientific background text and has been used as one out of four      tropical studies for      DOC losses from natural ecosystems and as one out of two tropical studies      on which the      methodology for anthropogenic DOC losses was based. As these numbers show,      the      scientific literature on anthropogenic DOC losses in the tropics is very      limited so that this      paper has been of particularly high value for the 2013 IPCC Wetlands      Supplement.' Given the contribution of DOC to understanding carbon balance within      these ecosystems, the      findings reported by Moore et al. (2013) will directly feed into future      REDD demonstration      projects that will have both local development and positive climate      benefits. In the UK, findings of Gauci and The Open University group have helped      shape a Defra-supported      research programme to look at the carbon dynamics response to peatland      restoration      work that has been highlighted in a government Natural Environment White      Paper `Natural      Choice: Securing the value of nature'. The OU component of the research      was to work on intact      and restored lowland fen sites at Wicken in Cambridgeshire to understand      the exchanges of      greenhouse gases including methane, N2O and CO2. The      project has been identified in the      White Paper as research that will demonstrate `...how best to manage our      lowland peatlands in      a way that supports efforts to tackle climate change'. The group's      research into controls on      methane emissions feeds directly into an Open University-led international      research network on      methane (www.methanenet.org), which has hosted a discussion meeting on      methane mitigation      (November 2011) and a session on the same subject at a major international      meeting (Planet      Under Pressure 2012) associated with the UN `Rio+20' meeting. The meetings      involved      policymakers and Planet Under Pressure 2012 was specifically geared to      communicating      science to policymaking bodies and NGOs.

As members of the Research Centre for Citizenship, Identities and      Governance (CCIG),      colleagues have been involved in a number of associated projects on sex,      sexualities and      relationships over the past eight years. These have included work on      family lives (Gabb, Fink),      lesbian and gay parenthood (Gabb, Langdridge), adoption (Fink), migrant      families and      transnational intimacies (Erel), sadomasochism (Langdridge, Barker),      bisexuality (Barker), and      relationship therapy (Vossler, Barker, Langdridge). Two leading journals      were founded and      continue to be edited by group members: Psychology & Sexuality,      published by Taylor and Francis      (Barker, Langdridge), and Families, Relationships and Societies,      published by Policy Press      (Featherstone, Gabb). Members of this sexuality and relationships group have conducted a number      of studies exploring      different minority community understandings of sexuality and      relationships, often working at the      interstices of the psychological and social. For instance, using data from      her empirical research,      Gabb has published widely on same-sex and heterosexual family experience      and how the      absence-presence of children impact on family sexuality and intimacy in      parental relationships.      Barker has headed up BiUK (the UK national organisation for bisexual      research and activism),      working closely with bisexual communities to conduct a series of linked      grass-roots research      projects into UK bisexual experience, including the annual BiCon survey.      OU research on      bisexuality, specifically, has informed two national and two international      conferences (BiReCon and      BiReConUS), with this work culminating in the production of The        Bisexuality Report. Langdridge      and Barker have drawn on their various research studies to bring together      academic work with      writing from activists, practitioners and community members in two edited      collections on      sadomasochism and consensual non-monogamous relationships, amongst      numerous other      academic articles. Research on couple relationships and family lives is embedded in and      developed through policy,      practice and community contexts. This work has been advanced through      collaboration with      national third sector organisations (Gabb, Fink, Vossler — Relate; Gabb —      Tavistock Foundation;      Barker — COSRT and the national LGB&T partnership) and community      networks (Fink, Community      Action MK; Milton Keynes Community Foundation; Barker, BiCon, BCN, The      Bisexual Index).

Global environmental change is one of the most pressing issues facing the      world today. Yet there seems little will to confront that challenge,      either among politicians or among publics. Research at The Open University      has addressed the mass media, specifically the BBC, as a key means by      which this inertia might be challenged. There are three main interlocking      aspects to this research. The first is rooted in Massey's (Professor, The Open University,      1982-2009, Emeritus Professor 2009-present) theorisation of relationality      [3.3], which highlights the importance of transnational relations      in producing people and places. Recognising and communicating the      interdependencies inherent in these geographical relations is an important      part of acknowledging and representing geographies of responsibility [3.4].      It is crucial to developing the fuller social and cultural imagination,      ethics and philosophy required by the anthropocene, as the impact of human      activity on the life of the planet becomes clearer [3.2; Nigel      Clark, Senior Lecturer, The Open University, 2000-12]. The second draws on Barnett's (Reader and Professor, The Open University,      2003-13) theorisation of the relationship between media and democracy [3.1],      which highlighted the need to engage diverse publics, as well as      identifying the indeterminacy of these publics. It is from this work that the third aspect of research has developed.      Smith (Senior Lecturer, The Open University, 2000-present) identified the      need for a new vocabulary to move debate and action about global      environmental change forward. His work confirms that there is public      disengagement from the environmental messaging of government and the      research and policy community [3.5; 3.6], and that this is not      simply because the public is not adequately informed. Smith developed an      `entangled web' model where, for example, climate change is seen as being      constructed globally through interactions between media, a host of other      actors, and diverse publics who already engage with climate change in      innovative ways. This research led to the successful (2006) Economic and      Social Research Council (ESRC) grant on Interdependence (Smith and Clark)      and to joint publications produced for academic [3.4] and      non-academic audiences [5.8]. The action research undertaken by Joe Smith between 1997 and 2013 saw him      co-directing 12 Real World seminars with senior media decision      makers, researchers and the policy community to discuss media handling of      issues such as risk, sustainability and representations of the global      South. These seminars were funded by Department of Environment (now      Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs), WWF UK, Bowring Group,      Vivendi, the Tyndall Centre and the ESRC Global Environmental Change      Programme. Building on earlier research into public disengagement from the      main environmental messaging of government and the research and policy      community [3.5] Smith used qualitative research methods      (recordings, note-taking and interviews) during the seminars, to diagnose      challenges to effective media handling of complex global issues [3.6]. Thus, drawing upon excellent research undertaken by erstwhile (Barnett,      Clark and Massey) and current (Smith) members of the Geography department      at The OU, cultural imaginations around environmental change and global      interdependencies have been opened up. The research has had impact in      directly informing richer representations of patterns of social, economic      and ecological interdependence, and of more dynamic interrelations. All journal articles appear in peer-reviewed journals. The monographs      have also been subject to peer review prior to publication and all have      had considerable significance in their field.

All      grants were peer reviewed. Impacts of research at The Open University on environment, development      and the media fall into three areas: The notion of `interdependence' as a way of theorising transnational      relations has informed public debates via: i. a series of sell-out public Interdependence Day events held at the      Royal Geographic Society (RGS) (350 participants on each occasion) and      Southbank's Bargehouse (1000 participants); ii. three Interdependence Reports, produced with the New      Economics Foundation (the last in 2009; 5.6), which gained wide      attention and obtained coverage in a range of news outlets. The Secretary      for State for International Development at the time, Hilary Benn, who      contributed to the volume Do Good Lives Have to Cost the Earth [5.7]      which directly drew on their arguments (e.g. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8461727.stm,      17 January 2010). The reports thus shaped modes of political thought. B. Impacts on content and tone of mainstream programming Since 2008, Smith's arguments about the need to expand the range of tones      and voices on climate change [5.3; 5.5] have led to a shift in the      BBC's approach to programming. Specific seasons and programmes widened the      range of contributors and perspectives (more global; more varied in      content; more direct testimony and thus engaging diverse publics) in      response to the seminars and the research underpinning them. Complementing his work on the Real World seminars, Smith worked      as a consultant on climate change for BBC Vision and News. Since 2004 he      has advised senior decision makers on climate change in order to foster      the cultural imaginations required in the contemporary anthropocene      period. Smith and colleagues' seminar work underpinned the commissioning      of groundbreaking material such as the world's first climate change      political thriller, Burn Up (BBC 2, 2008), and a Springwatch        Special (BBC 2, 2010). Burn Up launched with 2.6 million      viewers and 12.3% market share (46% higher than BBC 2's prime time      average), and average viewing figures for the Springwatch Special      were 2 million. Smith was academic adviser for both programmes. TV      producer John Lloyd (originator Blackadder and QI), who      participated at the Real World seminars, stressed their      `astonishing' impact, commenting that `none of this would have happened      without Joe Smith' and concluding that `It is a textbook example of how      essential it is to continue funding ""pure"" academic research because,      without it, the ""practical"" world would hardly change at all'. Shifts in BBC programming have been directly attributed to the seminars      organised by Smith, and often specifically to him, by academics [5.4];      bloggers [http://memex.naughtons.org/archives/2008/07/04/5287;      5.9]; reports [5.1]; and media, including two Mail on        Sunday stories (19 November 2011, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2063737/BBCs-Mr-Climate-Change-15-000-grants-university-rocked-global-warning-scandal.html;      26 November 2011, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066706/BBC-sought-advice-global-warming-scientists-economy-drama-music--game-shows.html). For instance, a storm of climate contrarian newspaper and blog activity      around the seminars charged Smith and his BBC partners with shaping BBC      policy on climate change: `Billed as its ""scientific adviser"" was Dr Joe Smith of The Open      University, the self-described ""action researcher"" who, as Harrabin's      partner in the CMEP [Cambridge Media Environment Programme], had helped      organise all those seminars to brief BBC staff on climate issues, notably      the gathering in 2006 which played such an important part in leading the      BBC to adopt a more committed stance in its coverage of global warming.'      (Booker, 2011, p. 73; 5.2) (Also see: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100223342/the-bbc-long-ago-became-a-mouthpiece-for-green-lunatics-why-does-it-pretend-otherwise/.)      Although      failing to represent the nature of the meetings accurately, these pieces      do demonstrate the continued and ongoing impact of Smith's research on BBC      programming. C. Directly commissioning new work Based on research insights about the need to engage diverse publics in      new ways, Smith also co-commissioned five hours of BBC World Service radio      programming as part of the Creative Climate project (Climate        Connections, 2009 and 2010,http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/programmes/2009/11/091118_climate_connection_listing.shtml)      and six BBC World News broadcasts (Hope in a Changing Climate,      2009,http://www.open.edu/openlearn/whats-on/ou-on-the-bbc-hope-changing-climate-0,      & and Earth Reporters, 2011, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-13359848).      These programmes covered pressing issues at the intersection of      environmental research and action. The reach of these programmes is evidenced by the audience figures:      advertisers on the channel accept viewing figures of 70 million on first      BBC World transmissions, and the BBC World Service Radio slots reached      approximately 40 million listeners. The TV and radio shows reached further      audiences (tens of thousands) via their free online screening on the Open      University, BBC and TVE platforms. These commissions were directly      informed by the research outputs outlined in section 2. They pursued the      research conclusions regarding the need for more plural and dynamic      representations of environmental change by means of a diary motif that is      threaded throughout the broadcast and web content in the Creative Climate      project. In a mould-breaking move, the research and policy communities are      represented in the films by a much more diverse body of leading      contributors, including researchers and policy experts based in the global      South and, specifically, young women scientists. Smith (working with BBC      Comedy Executive Producer Jon Plowman) also commissioned ten short films      arising out of a competition for young film-making talent http://www.bbc.co.uk/filmnetwork/features/creative_climate_shorts_2.      Collectively, these have been viewed at least 20,000 times online, and      screened at film festivals, including the British Film Institute Festival,      Futures Film Festival (winner) and Screentest 2013, and are evidence of      Smith's role in producing new cultural imaginations of environmental      change."

Professor Rymer      and colleagues have run several long-term volcano projects in      collaboration with the charity Earthwatch. Over 500 citizen scientists      have collected geophysical and environmental data since 2000. The work has      impacted on the lives of the volunteers, who are engaged and enthused by      scientific research, park wardens in Nicaragua who continue to monitor      long-term SO2 release, and authorities in Costa Rica, Iceland,      Italy and Nicaragua who use the citizen science data to mitigate the      environmental effects of persistent volcanism. Professor Hazel Rymer has led a group studying hazards arising from both      volcano eruption and gas release during persistent activity, providing      important new insights into the processes occurring at shallow depth      beneath persistently active volcanoes. A key aspect of the work has been      the involvement of volunteer citizen scientists, and also engagement with      local communities. The team has included Dr Steve Blake and Dr Mike      Gillman, and colleagues from other institutions including Professor      Corinne Locke (University of Auckland), Dr Hilary Erenler (Northampton      University), and Dr Glyn Williams-Jones (Simon Fraser University). Dr      Saskia van Manen, an independently funded Branco Weiss Research Fellow, is      researching the impact on society of fluctuations in volcanic activity in      Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The Volcanology and Ecology Project Citizen science fieldwork on volcanoes has been carried out almost every      year since 2008. The environmental volcanology project integrates      expertise in volcano monitoring, modelling and public engagement with the      delivery of comprehensive hazard awareness, preparedness and mitigation.      Professor Rymer has shown that unerupted magma can remain molten at      shallow depths for many months, and that magma movements can be detected      many years in advance of eruption; both are crucial to hazard mitigation      since natural variations and persistent activity affect the local      environment. High concentrations of gases at persistently active volcanic      sites can cause heavy metal pollution (heavy metals such as lead, copper      and zinc) of soil, water and the atmosphere. The implications for local      people include a build-up of pollutants in their agricultural crops. In recent years citizen scientists mapping the distribution of air plants      within and around such volcanoes have found that the location of these      plants mirrored results from the sulphur detection plates in indicating      levels of gas deposition. This provides a new way for local communities to      monitor gas flux from the volcano without the need for instrumentation and      lab analysis. The Microgravity and Volcano Hazards Project Citizen science fieldwork was carried out on volcanoes in Iceland over a      20-year period 1993-2013. Recent work in Iceland has built upon the many      earlier citizen science monitoring projects (e.g. Carbonne et al. 2010,      2011; Wooler et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2008; Gottsman et al.,      2008), and is focused around the ongoing subsidence within the main      caldera of Askja volcano in the north of Iceland. Ground deformation and      micro-gravity data collected by citizen scientists and volunteers have      been used to shed light on the processes responsible for unrest at this      large, central volcano. Increased seismicity and net micro-gravity      increases while the subsidence continued were the cause of considerable      speculation in the period 2008-10. A 20-year gravity time series at Askja      caldera shows a sharp contrast in behaviour at the caldera centre compared      with the margins. The observed reversal from long-term magma drainage to      magma accumulation below the caldera centre identified by these new      gravity data may be the first sign heralding the next phase of activity at      Askja (van Dalfsen 2011). Publications with contributions from citizen science: Grants: 2013: $100k awarded by SEG Foundation Geoscientists without Borders to      Professor Hazel Rymer for a project entitled `Developing integrated      volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation programs at persistently      degassing volcanoes'. 2008-13 £128k awarded by Earthwatch, The Centre for Field Research to      Professor Hazel Rymer for a project entitled `Environmental impact of      persistently active volcanoes'. 2008-13: £46k awarded by Earthwatch, The Centre for Field Research to      Professor Hazel Rymer for a project entitled `Icelandic volcanoes'. Professor Rymer's group is developing the new area of environmental      volcanology as citizen science, using a wide range of established and      emergent geophysical, geochemical and bioassay tools to investigate the      impact of chronic (background, persistent) volcanic activity on the local      environment. A critical feature of the group is that it is part of an      international network of collaborators working closely with local      communities, government-run volcano observatories and universities in      several countries. Citizen scientists volunteering to undertake      measurements on volcanoes represent a major theme common to many of the      studies. Earthwatch is the charity that has collaborated with the OU on many of      the recent citizen science expeditions. It offers untrained members of the      public the opportunity to work in peer-reviewed research projects and has      found that many returning citizens express very clear enthusiasm and      report positive experiences. Nigel Winser, Executive Vice President      (Observations) of the charity, commented: `Your work over many years with these individuals fulfils Earthwatch's      mission to engage people worldwide in scientific field research and      education to promote the understanding and action necessary for a      sustainable environment... These volunteers return and engage their wider      communities — in schools, in business, with other academics and in the      home — with their own outreach activities.' The following are examples of the substantial impact this approach is      having on the volunteers, policymakers and the local communities      surrounding the persistently active volcanoes in Iceland and South      America. Citizen scientist observations at Askja volcano in Iceland suggest that      magma has been accumulating beneath the caldera since 2007 and colleagues      at the Nordic Volcanological Institute increased their surveillance of the      area during the summer field seasons of 2009 onwards. The Open University      team has collaborated with local volcano scientists in this area over      several decades, and worked together with citizen scientists over much of      that period. Professor Guðmundsson, Professor of Geophysics and      Head of the Faculty of Earth Sciences, Reykavík, comments: `The decades-long collaboration with the volunteer Earthwatch teams has      been particularly valuable, since their contribution has led to fieldwork      campaigns that is difficult to see how could have been carried out in any      other way. Here are two important aspects that need to be considered.      Firstly, the volunteer participation brings resources into research that      would otherwise not be available. Secondly, the vast majority of all the      volunteers that have participated in your Earthwatch projects act as      proponents of science within the general public.' More recently, the group's work at Poás volcano, Costa Rica, involved      citizen scientists in predicting increased local environmental damage from      2009 and helped to inform the volcano observatory staff and National Park      officials who restricted access by the public to the crater area during      the degassing crisis of 2009-10, reducing the risk of injury. To mitigate      against such hazards, operational guidelines for monitoring and responding      to changes in volcanic degassing were put in place in Costa Rica and      Nicaragua in 2009. These will be essential for establishing short-term      responses to gas-related health emergencies, as well as medium-term land      management policies to reduce the effect of degassing on human and      agricultural activity. Both are of direct economic benefit to vulnerable      communities. The Open University group and several cohorts of citizen scientists have      worked closely with the Nicaraguan government body tasked with volcano and      environmental monitoring, and share all of the research results with them.      Educational material has been provided from this project to the National      Park Office and is now used in its visitor centre to inform the public      about volcanic risk and environmental impact. In the past year work has      begun with local farmers to study water quality with a view to advising on      safety for agriculture. This has educated and trained the wardens within      the National Park, who are now able to identify species of flora and fauna      that can be used to monitor poisonous gas levels, and has allowed them to      develop a more systematic recording of volcanic activity. More generally, several volcano observatories have benefited from this      research and the approach of using citizen scientists to both acquire data      and help integrate and involve local communities. Several observatories      and civil defence organisations and geological surveys have requested      collaboration and advice. Training has also been requested and given to      students from other higher education institutions (from the UK and      elsewhere).

Research design promoted interactions between stakeholders to achieve policy impact. Innogen developed a range of tooIs to disseminate research findings and influence policy in Europe, the African Union (AU), Kenya, Qatar and at the OECD. We used secondments and temporary placements to achieve impact, as well as more traditional activities and outputs, resulting in major policy impacts in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The ESRC Innogen Centre Innogen (ESRC Centre for Social and Economic Research on Innovation in Genomics) research has crossed geographic and disciplinary boundaries to find solutions to real-world challenges in global health, food and energy security, the environment and the economy. Appropriate Governance of the Life Sciences In 2002, Professors Joanna Chataway and David Wield (OU during the whole research period), Professor Joyce Tait (Visiting Professor, OU since 1993), with Drs Julius Mugwagwa (2004-), Anne Kingiri (2004-09) and Adele Langlois (2004-08), developed a research programme entitled, `Appropriate Governance of the Life Sciences' (AGLS). The OU programme has a global perspective with major empirical research results from Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia (1-3). AGLS focuses on the question: `Can the life sciences be better   regulated globally?' The research programme investigates regulation and governance broadly — within a framework of stakeholder interaction, rather than as barriers to simple linear progression — as key drivers of innovation. Using a `triangle' model to structure our pathway to impact, our work links three broad groups of stakeholders: innovators (scientists, medics, farmers, firms); government   and regulators (multilaterals, OECD, EU); and public advocacy groups (patient advocacy groups, NGOs). Our research demonstrates that inappropriate and overly complex regulation can prevent the development of innovative and potentially beneficial technologies in the life sciences (4). Work in more than 20 countries across four continents shows that regulation strongly influences which products are developed and which companies take the lead in their development, and that poor regulation decreases sectoral dynamism and plays into the dearth of innovation in new medicines and agricultural products (5-9). Through analysing pharmaceutical sector changes, Innogen has investigated new actors and institutions that are changing regulation and governance structures (4,   10), finding that advances have occurred in stratified medicine, rare and neglected disease innovation, stem cells, and synthetic biology, but regulatory systems are lagging behind. In agriculture, Innogen's findings show that US/European systems are driving biosafety, but differences between the US and Europe have stifled development and application of agro-biotechnologies in the South (5, 6, 9). These governance systems limit the opportunities for new entrant firms from developing countries. The significance of the research is evidenced by the successful review and consequent four-fold increase in funding from the ESRC to the OU Innogen Centre from 2007-14, by further competitive funds obtained (2-3), and by the independent evaluation that found that Innogen had the strongest density of UK interdisciplinary linkages between the social, health and biosciences as measured through Web of Science citations (see Rafols and Costa http://innogen.ac.uk/reports.php?id703).Their bibliographic maps evidence the `remarkable breath of Innogen and its exceptional degree of cross-citation'. The reach of the OU research can be evidenced, for example, by the 27 invited international conference presentations given since 2003 in 11 countries across 4 continents. 3.1 Relevant Grants 1) ESRC Innogen grant, 2002-14 (£7.5m).

Practical activities and outputs included producing: policy-oriented outputs (10, 11); publications read by practitioners, such as Nature Biotechnology (12); and policy and press briefings. In the REF period, the named researchers gave 39 talks in 11 countries to industry/government/international agency audiences; 21 workshops and public events; 3 select committee briefings. The Financial Times Pharmaceuticals Correspondent confirmed that the FT invited Chataway and Tait to prepare a session for their high-level Global Pharma conference (2009), because of the `significant policy relevance of their research' (19). Chataway maintained regular industry contact, leading to several research projects with pharma companies and the international Pharma Futures working group that began work in 2013. Additionally, Innogen supports the movement of researchers into policy environments as a way of maximising impact, and its staff are involved in numerous decision-making fora. Mugwagwa undertook placements at New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the AU (2007 and 2012), Langlois worked in the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology (POST) (2007) and Chataway held a part-time placement at RAND Europe (2010-13) and is currently vice-president of Globelics where she promotes policy-relevant research. Impact on European and global life science legislation, policy   formulation and   implementation Given the global nature of governance of life science products, such as pharmaceuticals and GM crops, European and global legislation and policy implementation has a direct effect on policy and legislation in developing countries. The OECD International Futures Project invited us to develop scenarios based on our research on the global healthcare sector trajectory. This work investigated possible trends in the development of health technologies and the bioeconomy, focusing on the period 2015-2030. Three scenarios were developed and published in an influential report, which concluded that wide-ranging governance reforms were necessary to ensuring best outcomes from biotechnology advances (10). 1985 copies were distributed, with 4851 downloads. The report constituted the basis of the work of the OECD Working Party on Biotechnology, comprising 33 member states, in formulating the influential new OECD policy on harmonisation in biotechnology, which subsequently led to its industrial biotechnology policy. The Director of the OECD International Futures Programme confirmed (14) the report was discussed and presented in 60 OECD working groups, to member state governments (including Japan, US, UK and Germany), and to 14 large-scale stakeholder events. He also confirmed that the work was `a crucial contribution' to the OECD's involvement and influence in biotechnology. The work of Adele Langlois has impacted public and policy discourse. As part of her doctoral studies, she secured a competitive scholarship from the Wellcome Trust to undertake a fellowship at POST (2008) to develop a policy briefing (13), widely distributed among peers and MPs. POST's Scientific Advisor for Biology and Health stressed the timeliness and policy relevance of the work, `which had been the reason for selecting Langlois's project for the   fellowship in the first place' (20).

Impact on African legislation and policy formulation and   implementation AGLS research has been used to frame and establish new African policy and regulation on drugs and agro-biotechnology. Innogen's relationship with the AU began in 2006 with advice that led to policy initiatives that improved and harmonised regulation of medicines and biosafety. Chataway, Mugwagwa et al wrote an invited report on building the case for health systems innovation in Africa, which the Science and Technology Advisor of NEPAD/AU confirmed formed the background document for the 8th Summit of the AU (2007). He confirmed also that the work informed ministerial-level discussions that led to the inter-ministerial agreement on the science and technology programme of NEPAD/AU, an example of international policy impact (15). Later, it was published as a book by the AU and made widely available in paper and online (11). 15,000 copies were distributed, and the book is now widely used by Ministries of Health throughout Africa in developing health policy. While attached to the NEPAD Office of Science and Technology (2007), Mugwagwa used the AGLS approach to develop a framework on medicine control harmonisation. The Director of the African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE) and the Scientific Affairs Officer of the Economic Commission for Africa confirmed that this work constituted a core dimension of the policy to harmonise drug regulation within the AU (16). In particular, it determined the agreed approach of cluster-based harmonisation, as opposed to horizontal harmonisation across all countries. In Kenya, Innogen research impacted agro-biotechnology legislation and policy, as a result of Kingiri's work with government agencies. During her OU doctorate (2004-08), she worked on the implementation of the Kenyan National Biosafety Act using Innogen approaches. Following completion in 2009, she joined the African Centre for Technology Studies in Kenya and was invited to join the team drafting regulations later appended to the Biosafety Act. She contributed to four draft regulations (environmental release; import, export and transit; contained use; labelling) approved in 2011 and 2012. The Biosafety Director of the Kenyan Biosafety Authority (KBA) confirmed the importance of her work and involvement from the initial stages of the development of the policy in 2008 (17). In addition, he stated that Kingiri and her Innogen experience were instrumental in the development of Kenya's first guidelines for inspection and monitoring of genetically modified (GM) field trials, a clear example of policy impact. Kingiri is also a registered member of the Kenyan Roster of Experts on Biosafety and the KBA confirmed Kingiri's Innogen experience as important for her major role advising on new applications for GMO field trials in Kenya. Impact on Qatar national research strategy In Qatar, working with RAND researchers, Chataway used Innogen research on research governance and as PI, led a project that resulted in the Qatar National Research Strategy 2012 with its strong focus on responsible and participative development of life sciences, health and environment. The Executive Director of the Research Division of the Qatar National Research Foundation stated that Chataway's expertise and leadership was fundamental in formulating the strategy, which has been formally adopted as national policy. Implementation is underway (18). In summary, Innogen's research question, `Can the life sciences be   better regulated globally?' has led to significant influence and impact, which suggests not only that regulation (and related governance frameworks) can be improved, but also that Innogen has played a significant role in its improvement. 5.1 Examples of publications produced with policy makers 10.)

These findings have influenced policy debates and developments      internationally through reports by the ILO and expert meetings of the      European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. This research at Cranfield School of Management examined the impact of      flexible working on an individual's performance at work. It also explored      the factors influencing successful implementation of flexible working      practices. Cranfield research challenged the idea that providing flexible working      arrangements was simply a cost to the employer, by demonstrating that      through offering these arrangements to all employees firms could generate      performance benefits [R1, R4, R6]. Our work identified a number of      factors influencing successful implementation of flexible working      practices, indicating that organisational benefits were gained where      flexible working was implemented into an appropriate environment and where      other HR policies had been altered to reflect the changed arrangements of      flexible workers [R3, R5]. The findings showed evidence of a positive association between flexible      working and individual performance [R1, R6]. Flexible workers,      managers and co-workers of flexible workers reported a generally positive      effect on the quantity and quality of work performed, with very little      evidence of a detrimental effect. In comparison to those on standard      working arrangements, flexible workers had significantly higher scores on      organisational commitment. The higher levels of work effort and commitment      arose from a form of reciprocation or exchange from employees grateful for      the ability to exercise some control over their working patterns [R1,        R2, R6]. Higher levels of job satisfaction were derived from the      ability to pursue a career and achieve a more satisfactory work-life      balance [R1, R2]. The research uncovered the prevalence of informal flexible working in      many of the case organisations [R1, R2, R3]. With the exception of      reduced hours working, informal arrangements between an employee and their      line manager were more common than arrangements which had been agreed via      the formal request process. The research demonstrated the need to review existing HR policies when      introducing flexible working. Policies designed for employees on      `standard' working arrangements could inadvertently disadvantage employees      with flexible working arrangements [R5]. The conclusions suggest a      training need both for those moving to different working arrangements and      for those managing them [R3]. Cranfield conducted the research in partnership with the charity Working      Families and a consortium of seven companies that sponsored the research      (Centrica, Citigroup, KPMG, Lehman Brothers, Microsoft, Pfizer, Rolls      Royce). The research comprised seven case studies, 123 semi-structured      interviews, 10 focus groups and a 93-item electronic questionnaire (3580      responses). It examined how changes to the place, timing and amount of      work influenced both direct (quantity, quality, ability to work in team)      and indirect (job satisfaction, organisational commitment, stress)      outcomes for employee performance. Types of flexible working included in      the study included reduced hours working; remote working (where employees      worked in a different location for some of their working time); flexitime      arrangements where employees worked at different times from the normal      hours for the workplace.

Cranfield's research into the impact of flexible working on an      individual's performance at work has demonstrated that offering flexible      working arrangements to employees brings performance benefits to      organisations [S9]. This has informed debate in policy and      professional organisations in the UK and internationally. A number of      policy documents have also cited our research as evidence. The research was the sole source of evidence for the government to      introduce legislation extending the right to request flexible working      first to parents of older children, then to carers and finally to all      employees. The government introduced a series of legislative amendments      broadening the scope to cover all employees in the UK. Until the first      change only parents of children aged up to six, or up to 18 if the child      was disabled, were eligible to apply for flexible working arrangements. Policy Cranfield research influenced debate and policy development in national      and international organisations by providing evidence about the      implementation and outcomes of flexible working. These organisations have      included the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (an independent      statutory body with a mandate to challenge discrimination and protect and      monitor human rights), the Chartered Institute of Personnel and      Development (CIPD), Eurofound (the European Foundation for the Improvement      of Living and Working Conditions), the International Labour Organisation      (ILO) and the United Nations. The research is cited in two documents published by the Equalities and      Human Rights Commission [S1, S2] demonstrating the business case      for flexible working. The ILO also cited our research in a report on      working time and productivity [S4]. The CIPD used our work in a      Factsheet for members on Flexible Working. Cranfield researchers presented the project findings and participated in      Expert Groups at the European Foundation, `Eurofound' (Dublin, June, 2011)      [S3] and the United Nations (New York, November, 2010). The purpose      of the Eurofound expert meetings on `organisation of working time:      Implications for productivity and working conditions' was to feed into the      foundation's work in the field and to help identify priority areas for      future Eurofound research. The purpose of the United Nations Expert Group on Work-Life Balance      Policies and Practice was to identify good practices and lessons learned      and to develop recommendations for policies and practices to strengthen      the implementation of work-life balance policies, including flexible      working arrangements, in the United Nations system globally. Legislation In April 2009 the Flexible working (Eligibility, Complaints and Remedies)      (Amendment) Regulations came into force [S6]. These regulations      extended the right to request flexible working arrangements to parents of      children up to 16 years of age - offering this opportunity to an      additional 4.5 million people (Department for Business, Enterprise and      Regulatory Reform. (August 2008)). Prior to this change the Secretary of      State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), Rt Hon John      Hutton MP, commissioned Imelda Walsh, HR Director of J Sainsbury plc to      conduct an independent review and to examine the case for extending the      case for extending the right to request to parents of older children. She      consulted the key researchers on this research project. The report to the minister, the Walsh Review, published in May 2008 [S5]      drew extensively on our report, ""Flexible Working and Performance:        summary of the research"" (see section 2), as providing important and      exclusive evidence of the benefits which employers can gain from offering      flexible working practices to their employees, such as better retention      and improvements to productivity. The subsequent consultation document      commissioned by BERR [S7] during the autumn 2008 also cited our      research report. The government subsequently accepted the recommendations proposed in the      Walsh Review and amended the legislation to put them into effect. In 2012 the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, announced plans to give      every employee in the UK the right to request flexible working      arrangements [S8].

The impact of the research has been: The design of jet-lift vertical or short take-off and landing (V/STOL, or      STOVL — short take-off and vertical landing) aircraft introduces      significant aerodynamic complexities. In particular, in vertical flight      the lifting jets point downwards and the entrained air flow induces a      download on the airframe. This download is exacerbated close to the ground      when the lift jets hit the ground and spread out to flow radially. This      so-called wall jet has a number of consequences: Understanding the characteristics of the wall jet and ground vortex — and      how they vary with operating and design conditions — is crucial for the      efficient design and safe operation of jet-lift V/STOL aircraft. Over the past 20 years Cranfield University has studied jet-induced      flowfields with the aim of understanding and reducing the adverse effects      of these flows on V/STOL aircraft. Our projects have addressed various      flow phenomena, including the development of wall jets from single and      multiple impinging jets [P2], jet/intake interactions [P3, P6], jet mixing      [G1, P6], coannular impinging jets, mean and fluctuating flowfields      associated with the ground vortex [G2, P1, P4], and unsteady fountain      flows [G3, P5]. Our initial studies were aimed at understanding factors that controlled      the location and size of the ground vortex formed when a jet hits the      ground in a cross-flow [P1]. Our results quantified the differences      between impingement on fixed and moving ground planes, confirmed      self-similarity rules for the size of the ground vortex, revealed the      levels of unsteadiness of the ground vortex, and presented initial      findings on multiple jet interactions in cross-flows. This work led us to      more detailed studies of some of the fundamental flow features involved,      starting with the wall jet that feeds the ground vortex. In the next stage of our research we investigated wall-jet flows produced      by jets hitting the ground [P2]. This showed the influence of initial free-jet conditions on the      development of the wall jet, and the significance of the angle at which      the free jet strikes the ground on the growth of the wall jet. This led to      Cranfield's subsequent studies on the detailed flowfields produced by      multiple impinging jets [P5]. In parallel with our fundamental wall jet studies, we conducted      more-applied research into the mutual interference between free-jet      entrainment flowfields and aircraft intake-induced flows [P3, P6]. More recently Cranfield has used laser-based flow measurement techniques      to investigate unsteady features of the ground vortex [G2, P4] and the      fountain upwash flow produced by multiple impinging jets [G3, P5]. This      work has revealed the stochastic nature of these flowfields.

The wind-tunnel test programme for the JSF jet effects,      involving over 4000 hours in a large multi-national facility, used a fixed      ground plane. This programme alone is estimated to have cost some £5      million; a moving ground plane for such a facility would have cost an      additional £4 million. Our findings allowed the fixed-ground results to be      corrected by engineers in BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin, without the      need for an expensive moving-ground simulation, [C1]. Similarly, BAE Systems used our work on wall-jet development [P2] to      predict safe operating conditions for ground personnel working in the      vicinity of a V/STOL aircraft [C2]. Wall jets, produced by propulsion jets      hitting the ground, grow in thickness radially and with increasing nozzle      height above the ground. Our work showed that the rate of growth with      nozzle height is not linear, contrary to extrapolations from      previously-published data, and that above about 10 nozzle diameters the      growth rate of the wall jet reduces significantly. This allowed much more      accurate predictions of the thickness of the wall jet produced by a      landing aircraft. This, in turn, allows smaller exclusion zones for ground      personnel and, hence, allows a less restrictive operating envelope for the      aircraft. Our research on jet/intake interactions showed that there was a mutual      aerodynamic interference which would not have been accounted for by      separate powered wind-tunnel model and independent intake tests.      Nevertheless, this effect was shown to be sufficiently small that it did      not require the expense and complexity of fully-powered wind-tunnel models      with simulated jets and intakes to be mounted on force balances [C1].      These results fed into the development of the JSF to provide confidence in      the separate testing of jets and intakes. A combined model, with both      powered jets and powered intakes, would have been impractical and would      have cost more than £1M. Our research saved this expense and gave      designers increased confidence in the validity of their design, mitigating      the risk of an overly restrictive operating envelope for the aircraft.      Overall, an improved, more accurate design process allows for a shortened      flight-test programme. For a complex V/STOL aircraft like the JSF, even a      straightforward flight-test programme costs more than £100M; many times      more if poor design decisions have been taken. Cranfield's work on co-annular jet flows led to the conclusion that a      gas-driven lift fan, producing a jet with a high-speed outer stream and a      lower-speed inner stream, was not a viable solution for a V/STOL aircraft      because of thrust loss when close to the ground. This allowed government      and industry to drop this as a design possibility, saving many £billions      in wasted development costs, [C3]. The impact of Cranfield's research was enhanced by the delivery of a      series of continuing professional development courses to engineers and      project managers from industry and government agencies. The course,      ""Fundamentals of V/STOL Aircraft Design with Joint Strike Fighter      Applications"", has so far been delivered by international experts eight      times in the UK and the US, with Cranfield staff delivering lectures on      V/STOL jet effects. The most recent courses ran in Fort Worth, Texas      (2009), home of Lockheed Martin's Joint Strike Fighter engineering and      assembly facility, and in Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland (2010      [C4]), where the Joint Strike Fighter is undergoing flight testing. More      than 300 delegates, primarily from industry and government agencies,      attended these courses, which provided both broad and deep knowledge of      the varied technical aspects of V/STOL jet aircraft design. The courses      raised the competence levels of the design teams and helped them to ensure      the validity of their designs [C1].

The impact of Cranfield's icing research is in the design processes for: Understanding aircraft icing is a critical part of the safety, operation      and design protocols for all aircraft. At temperatures below -30°C there      is no significant liquid water on an aircraft. At temperatures up to 5°C,      ice and liquid water exist on an aircraft's surfaces. It is important to      understand the flow patterns of impacting water, where the ice forms and      how much ice forms. Knowing this, aircraft designers can then decide where      to incorporate heating to prevent the formation or build-up of ice. Until the mid-1990s, aircraft designers used an ad hoc model that did not      correctly capture the momentum balance of the flowing water. Cranfield      developed an improved mathematical system which accurately models the      energy, momentum and conservation laws for water and ice. The underlying model uses lubrication theory. Cranfield's researchers      enhanced this to include the freezing and melting processes and the      geometry of the airframe and its components [P1]. The boundary conditions      associated with these systems are complex, the system of differential      equations degenerates. Surface tension effects were modelled using a      pre-cursor film approach. The nature of the flow fields observed in this class of flows are      characterised by very sharp gradients. Cranfield undertook significant      work to devise Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes which provided      accurate and reliable predictions [P2-P4]. Other aspects of the research include: A key aspect of this work is that the code(s) developed at Cranfield have      been integrated into the design and certification processes. This forced      obvious requirements on software development standards. Moreover, the code      had to be compatible with the design codes of various collaborating      organisations. Cranfield developed number of data format translators to      support integration with commercial and in-house codes for computational      fluid dynamics; this was important to make the code accessible to industry      engineers. Following problems in service, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA)      led an activity to expand icing requirements to force aircraft      manufacturers to address icing due to larger droplets such as freezing      drizzle. To support this activity, Cranfield undertook research projects      to provide experimental data and analysis on large droplet icing. This      work has shown how larger droplets impact different areas of the airframe      and have different splash characteristics. This data has allowed ice      prediction codes, such as ICECREMO, to be adapted to improve their      accuracy for larger droplets. This capability is helping to underpin the      industry's response to the FAA's new requirements [P5, P6].

Specific details are company      confidential, since they form part of the core business processes; three      statements from the technical leads in major organisations explain how the      work has had impact. Airbus [C1] Airbus uses the computational and experimental aircraft icing programmes,      including developments of the ICECREMO programs, as part of all major      development programmes. The annual expenditure of these programmes is      several billion euros. The codes support design decisions relating to ice      risks associated with regions where air flow is strongly three      dimensional. The certifying authorities accept this type of analysis as      part of the certification documentation [C2]. Since 2008, Airbus programmes where ICECREMO derivatives have been      extensively employed include A350, A400M and the A320 (new engine option).      In the case of the A400M, Airbus used the work by Hammond and Alègre [P6]      to justify how ice formed by runback water (runback ice) is represented on      a sub-scale wind tunnel model. In 2006, Airbus performed the final A400M      Wind Tunnel test, which included runs to investigate the sensitivity to      the aircraft handling qualities to runback ice. Those wind tunnel tests      demonstrate the most critical ice shape and also justify that the wing      performance is acceptable even when degraded by the icing degraded wing      anti-icing performance is acceptable, in terms of the effect of any      runback ice on an aircraft's handling qualities. Runback ice shapes were      generated in the Cranfield Wind Tunnel and the experiments showed that      using surface roughness alone resulted in a similar disturbance to the      boundary layer as the moulding of runback ice taken from the wind tunnel      validating the experimental approach. Airbus also used this work to show      that for the A350 it was appropriate to apply roughness elements smaller      than 3mm to runback ice shapes. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)      gave icing clearance certification by June 2013. A further example of the use of ICECREMO is in a response to a challenge      Airbus received from the airworthiness authorities. The US FAA asked      Airbus to justify the use of 2D icing codes to predict ice on the A350      wing. The FAA suggested that Airbus could make comparisons against a 3D      code. Airbus compared the droplet catch efficiencies with another code      (from ONERA) and ice shapes with those from ICECREMO, demonstrating good      agreement between both codes. This satisfied the FAA that in using 2D      icing codes we were adequately capturing the 3D effects of ice accretion      on a swept/tapered/twisted wing. The ICECREMO comparisons were presented      to EASA and the FAA on 2nd March 2010. They were satisfied with      the Airbus response. This was a key milestone in the certification      process: type certification is expected in the middle of 2014. BAE Systems [C3] BAE Systems has made extensive use of technology and software developed      within ICECREMO 2, to support internal programmes and to provide      consultancy to outside organisations. Internal programmes to BAE supported by this technology include: Code use and support for external customers including icing analysis of      2008-07/2013: These are examples of business which would not have been possible without      the original ICECREMO technology development. Direct contract work      undertaken by BAE Systems associated with these programmes is estimated to      be approximately £600,000. Although the business impact is difficult to quantify, the technology has      provided a capability, through its 3D modelling ability, for assessment of      aspects of airframe design and performance not otherwise readily      achievable. ICECREMO codes have been used to provide design guidance, e.g.      specification of ice protection systems and location of icing sensors. In      addition to providing design guidance, this has a direct impact on risk      and safety assessment. Rolls-Royce [C4] Rolls-Royce has found the modularity and clear methodology of the      ICECREMO code especially useful in developing its own in-house analysis      tools and methods. In one form or another, the main elements of code have      been used in all current large civil aircraft projects up to and including      the Trent XWB. The methods have proved to be very valuable in supporting a      shift of emphasis of the certification process away from expensive,      on-wing and simulated altitude testing, to analysis and numerical      simulation backed up with ground testing. It is difficult to put a figure on the economic benefit as this      capability is one of many essential to how Rolls-Royce currently works. In      essence, the level of fidelity of the company's current analysis methods      is high enough that, whilst it spends more time on analysis, the      dependence on experimental work is reduced, resulting in significant      financial savings.

Cranfield identified that fully automated dry hyperbaric welding for      deep-water applications was going to be a major requirement for the      sustainability of UK and world fossil fuels. Deep-water hydrocarbon      recovery had grown steadily since 1990 to become a significant fraction of      offshore oil and gas production by this time. This production is likely to      grow significantly over the coming decade due to depletion of reserves in      shallow waters. Cranfield established a facility, unique in the world then      and now, to enable the study and development of arc welding, in all      positions, up to a gas pressure of 250 bar, equivalent to 2,500 metres      water depth (P1 & G1). Following the establishment of this facility,      Cranfield conducted extensive research into gas metal arc and plasma      welding at high pressures (P2-5, G2, 3). Cranfield's initial work focussed on the behaviour of welding arcs and      metallurgy at elevated pressures in the downhand position, i.e. the      electrode located above the job (P2, 3, 5, G2). As expected, we found      significant departures from conventional welding. At high pressures,      operating parameters are constrained by stability considerations, leaving      limited scope for weld pool and weld property modification. Despite this,      robust and tolerant GMAW and plasma operating parameters were found for      positional welding that were largely insensitive to orientation. The problems we encountered included arc instability and poor metal      transfer characteristics due to high gas pressures, high susceptibility to      hydrogen cracking and other defects due to the high cooling rate in a      moist environment. We arrived at solutions to these problems by systematic      study of the arc characteristics, determination of thermal cycles and an      investigation of welding consumables with varying alloy compositions (P5,      G3). The result of these studies was a new power source control strategy      with high capability power source configurations, optimised electrical      transients and waveforms, combined with optimised filler materials (P5,      P6, G3).

Cranfield's research into gas metal-arc welding has led to new ways of      connecting and repairing subsea pipelines that are changing the nature of      off-shore hydrocarbon operations. The technology allows pipeline      operations in increasingly deeper waters, making it possible for the      development of previously inaccessible hydrocarbon reserves. The continuous increase in demand for oil and natural gas resulted in      sustained growth of off-shore oil and gas production. Offshore crude oil      production can be broadly classified in three categories based on the      depth of water; shallow water (< 400 m), deep water (400 to 1500 m) and      ultra-deep water (> 1500 m). Since the mid-1960s, the rate of offshore      production of oil and natural gas growth was on a rise till about middle      of 1990s, when offshore production reached a plateau. This could be      attributed to the depletion of fossil fuel in the shallow water region as      deep-sea exploration showed a significant growth during that period.      Concurrently deep-water recovery has dramatically increased and now      comprises more than 20% of total offshore production. This figure is      likely to rise significantly over the coming decades as shallow reserves      are further depleted. Critical to all offshore oil and gas recovery are pipelines for      connecting well heads and for transporting hydrocarbons to vessels or      onshore. A process known as a hot tapping is required when an operator      wants to expand the coverage of an oilfield. In this process a      T-connection is welded to an existing pipeline while oil or gas continues      to flow [C3]. In addition, subsea pipelines can require maintenance, often      requiring repair if they are suffering from, e.g. cracking due to      environmental degradation or occasional accidental damage. For larger pipe      diameters, beyond depths where divers can operate, this may be achieved by      the sleeve repair method. In this operation, the pipeline is cut, a sleeve      pre-welded onto a spool piece is slid over the subsea pipe end and this is      welded, subsea, using dry hyperbaric welding. The only viable welding      method for these operations beyond diver depths is remote dry hyperbaric      GMAW [C4]. The operation involves lowering a specially designed subsea      habitat around the pipe to be welded and filling the habitat with inert      gas to displace the water. Remotely operated tools are then used to align      the pipes, prepare the pipe surfaces before performing the welding      operation. Following the detailed research programme and process development, subsea      remote welding equipment and welding procedures were specified by Statoil.      Offshore field trials took place in 2011 in a Norwegian Fjord at world      record depths of 350msw for the remote hot tap and 970msw for sleeve      repair. This involved further extensive detailed studies of process      sensitivity, repeatability (in all positions) and further optimisation for      both remote hot tap and sleeve repair applications at various water depths      with different consumables. In 2012, further fully integrated offshore      trials with the remote hot tap equipment, validated the welding process      for production application [C5]. Formal specifications for hyperbaric weld procedures, arising from      Cranfield's research, have now been approved by Det Norske Veritas (DNV)      for different applications as a part of a standard [C6]. The first production application was a remote hot tap installation      carried out in connection with the preparations for the Åsgard Subsea Gas      Compression project in the Norwegian Sea. The remote Tee was welded on to      the Åsgard B production flowline at a water depth of 265 metres.      Sophisticated remotely operated subsea tools and a subsea welding tool      installed the Tee on a live gas pipeline [C1, 2]. Completion of the Åsgard      Subsea Compression project will take place in 2015, as the first of its      kind in the world. Compressors will be installed on the seabed, instead of      on a platform. This will improve recovery from the Mikkel and Midgard      reservoirs by around 280 million barrels of oil equivalents, worth more      than 28 billion dollars at today's prices. There are many beneficiaries of the research, both economic and      environmental. Economic benefits arise through significant additional oil      recovery. This benefits governments through taxes (including the UK), oil      & gas companies through profits and society in general through lower      energy prices. Other beneficiaries include the pipeline operators who lay      and maintain pipelines and companies who manufacture and maintain the      equipment associated with the processes. Environmental benefits arise      through the ability to repair subsea structures at great depths. As      illustrated by the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of      Mexico, it is difficult to deal with catastrophes of this nature at these      depths. The new repair processes developed at Cranfield provide ways to      avoid future events and to deal with them should they occur.

Cranfield created a fibre tufting unit in 2003 [G1]. It used an      industrial sewing head to create 3D (z-direction) reinforcement in      addition to the traditional layers and winding, to improve shear and      delamination resistance. In 2005, an interface between a robot and the      tufting tool was added, along with the software routines enabling its      practical use for composite preform reinforcement. Cranfield had investigated stitching of dry preform plies in the previous      decades. However, at the beginning of this century there was no systematic      research work dedicated to tufting as a method for reinforcing composites,      through-thickness. Cranfield published the outcome of the initial work in      2007 in the first two papers dedicated to this technology [P1, 2]. In 2006 Boeing wanted to replace a heavy metal structure with a lighter      composite alternative. The objective was to meet the stringent performance      requirement for a structure that would be used within the 787 Dreamliner's      landing gear. When Aircelle and Messier-Bugatti-Dowty (MBD), parts of the      Safran aerospace group, approached Cranfield, tufting capabilities were      limited to processing flat preforms that inserted glass fibre or aramid      thread tufts through relatively small thicknesses of material (up to      38mm). Nevertheless, the specifics of the component made it impossible for      the through-thickness reinforcement to be carried out with any other form      of stitching apart from tufting. Aircelle wanted to use a carbon-fibre      thread to form tuft loops fully embedded within the thick shaft of a 1.2m      long brace with large lugs at each end. Cranfield therefore embarked on a      research programme to investigate the potential for tufting using carbon      fibre threads. Our research met these requirements, demonstrating the      improvement in terms of delamination resistance provided by tufting [P3,      6]. Cranfield's researchers tackled several challenges, starting with the      requirement to use a carbon fibre thread which, at the time, was not      readily available on the market. All available grades were too brittle to      withstand needle penetration through tight preforms. The size and shape of      the preform and the particular material combination of the part demanded      novel customised hardware arrangements for the tufting unit, as well as      the development of dedicated controlling routines. We identified an innovative carbon-fibre thread (at the time still under      development by Toho Tenax) and acquired and successfully tested the      material on Cranfield's tufting system. Cranfield undertook innovative      modifications to the robot setup to accommodate the large preform and      developed the routines to enable tufts insertion on complex double      curvature surfaces. These developments were based on Cranfield's      exploratory research on the feasibility of the technology [P1] and its      optimal utilisation for enhancing mechanical performance [P2]. The      prototypes were impregnated with thermoset resin after tufting and      mechanically assessed by Aircelle. The company now produces carbon fibre      braces reinforced by tufting with carbon thread (figure 1) in its premises      with a newly acquired twin-robot tufting cell. These landing gear systems      have been flying on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its maiden flight in      2010.

The tufted composite braces, based on      technologies developed at Cranfield, are the first use of structural      composites in the landing gear of a commercial aircraft (figure 2). The      use of Cranfield's tufting technology to assemble and reinforce the      sub-components of the 3D woven preform has enabled Aircelle and MBD to      achieve their goals in terms of material performance [C2, 7]. The advantages of composites over the traditional steel components are:      weight saving due to improved strength-to-weight ratio of the constituent      material, which become significant considering that each Boeing 787 is      equipped with eight such braces; higher resistance to corrosion, reducing      maintenance work and servicing costs; higher resistance to fatigue;      greater in-service reliability; and longer service time between overhauls.      Ultimately the weight saving gives benefits in reduced fuel burn and CO2      emissions, and better competitiveness for the manufacturer. A traditional laminated composite could not bear the complex axial and      shear loading pattern expected in such a critical structure, or withstand      impact from potential bird strikes or debris flying from a runway. The      adoption of a composite structure with a 3D fibre architecture was,      therefore, an essential requirement in the material selection for the      composite brace. Three-dimensional weaving technologies allow the production of preforms      with fibres arranged along three main directions, however, complex shapes      are difficult to produce in a single step. The preform for the brace had      to be manufactured as two subcomponents, subsequently tufted together. The      option of using tufting within such an innovative manufacturing process      had never been attempted before. Cranfield had to conduct several      preliminary trials and tests on simple preforms to assess the tufting unit      ability to produce the required result. (Figure 3 shows an example of the      use of tufting in a complex aerospace component.) The preformed part was manufactured at Aircelle as two subsections of 3D      woven carbon-fibre tows around a core of aluminium honeycomb. However, the      designers required extra fibre reinforcement to be inserted      through-the-thickness of the preform to join the two subsections and to      enhance its damage tolerance. Cranfield's research showed that it could      meet these requirements, demonstrating the improvement in terms of      delamination resistance provided by tufting. This was established with the      investigation of the influence of tufting incorporation on interlaminar      behaviour, showing improvements in delamination toughness in the range of      60%-400%, whilst preserving in-plane properties, and the development of      validated predictive models enabling consideration of property      modification to be integrated within the design phase [C6]. The prototypes have gone into full production by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty      and are currently flying on the world's fleet of Boeing 787s [C7]. The      value to business can be appreciated by considering that landing gear      typically comprises 2% of the cost of wide body jets. The price of the 787      is estimated at $200M and the current (2013) cumulative orders are circa      930 aircraft. The contract to supply Boeing Commercial aircraft was a      first for Safran / Messier-Bugatti-Dowty and secures workshare for up to      20 years. The extensive use of composite materials for the airframe of      this the new aircraft has brought benefits of weight reduction and      consequent fuel economy. The Cranfield work has now extended the use of      these materials into critical landing gear systems giving Messier-      Bugatti-Dowty access to similar weight reducing advantages to their      products [C3-5, 7].

Cranfield has trained      over 700 engineers from over 50 companies in cost engineering based on our      research. Cranfield University started research on cost engineering to understand      the extant basis of cost prediction in the design, manufacture and service      of components and industry's understanding of affordability, in the late      1990s. The goal was to understand the science and engineering behind      current industrial practice so that cost engineering could become more      scientific and systematic in the future. Our studies established the best      practice in true cost prediction, and have developed software tools and      training, which have improved the competitiveness of UK manufacturing      companies. We studied how cost engineers think, and modelled the cognitive      processes behind the engineering judgement necessary for the cost      prediction [G1, 3, P1]. The study involved analysing the reasoning process      followed during cost estimating by both experts and novices. Research into      this cognitive process became the foundation for our cost engineering      training, which has been developed for industry since 2003. The Cranfield team progressed to research best practice in predicting the      cost of new technologies, based on analogy, in collaboration with the      automotive industry [P2]. Then the team focused on predicting cost of      design, manufacturing and assembly at the conceptual design stage for      complex engineering systems, e.g. for aircraft wings and hydraulic      systems. The scope of this prediction covered the design effort, including      both the thinking time and the Computer Aided Design model development      time, based on the complexity of the product [G2-4, P3]. The research      included both mechanical and electronic components design and testing.      Novel techniques (e.g. function based cost estimating for automotive      components) were developed which can predict more realistic cost at the      conceptual design stage, in the absence of data of good quality and      quantity [P4]. Our research focused on predicting the cost of in-service issues,      especially within performance based contracts. The key challenges      addressed in the research are: — predicting the cost of the resolution of component and material    obsolescence, based on a probabilistic approach [G5, P5]; — modelling service uncertainty within the cost estimates using an analogy    based approach [G5, P6]. The probabilistic cost estimation approach identified the relationships      between component complexity and obsolescence resolution profile. We      identified that the cost efficiency achieved by organisations in relation      to obsolescence correlates with how proactive they are in managing the      problem. Understanding of this has informed the design of new tools for      predicting the non-recurring engineering effort/cost for obsolescence      resolution [P5]. The analogy and uncertainty based cost estimating technique identifies the    new challenges related to availability contracts, and enables a systematic    approach that reflects the impact of uncertainties on the cost drivers [P6].    The research identifies a cost distribution for the service provision using    a stochastic simulation. The research also allows us to understand the    enduring cost profile across a product/system/service life cycle and is    fundamental to improving UK capability in cost modelling for large and    complex projects in industry and the public sector. * highest grade in period given Evidence of quality — peer-reviewed journal papers * 3 identified references that best indicate the quality of the research.

Cranfield developed a best practice process and software tool to predict      the obsolescence resolution cost for electronic components and materials      (figure 1). The tool helps to reduce the UK defence costs in two ways: — the contingency sums that defence contractors would have incorporated      into availability contracts to resolve obsolescence issues will be lower      because the tool enables the costs to be predicted with greater accuracy      and confidence — defence contractors will have a greater incentive to design equipment      with a view to minimising obsolescence issues. A DTZ estimate shows £213 million per annum financial benefit for the      sectors (BAE Systems and MoD only) [C1, 2]. Cranfield's software tool is      disseminated to other defence companies by MoD through a support contract      [C3]. The research in cost engineering helped BAE Systems and MoD      systematically to identify uncertainties in cost estimation, and the tool      developed is used within BAE Systems to prepare bids [C4]. The research      has also significantly influenced the national and international policy of      the Association of Cost Engineers (ACostE), and promoted the need for a      scientific approach to cost engineering in industry and government      organisations [C5]. In addition, the Cranfield team developed cost models      that were used within Airbus as part of the ""CADCO"" project toolbox to      evaluate conceptual designs of new aircrafts [C6]. This enables Airbus to      understand better the costs in the early phases of new projects, with      calculated uncertainty. The team helped Airbus to implement the CADCO tool      set across Europe and provided extensive training. Cost Engineering at Cranfield has developed novel approaches and tools        to predict the true whole life cost of complex engineering systems [C7,        C8]. Cranfield has provided cost engineering training for over 12 years        and has trained over 700 engineers in over 50 companies with an        indicative financial impact of £12 million per annum. Cranfield's effort        in improving the cost engineering practice across defence, aerospace,        automotive, railway, oil and gas companies has resulted in more        recognition of cost as a design driver and has helped in improving the        competitiveness. The indicative financial benefit from cost engineering        software developed at Cranfield (figure 1) is over £400 million per        annum [C2], and the UK MoD is disseminating the software to more        companies such that and the financial impact will be further increased        significantly. To estimate savings, we consider that the UK civil aerospace sector        alone has revenue of £12 billion per annum [C9]. The training delivered        by the Cranfield team is estimated to help British aerospace companies        to gain at least an additional 0.01% of this market, which is an        additional £12 million per annum new business.

Methodology has been adopted in ISO standards BS ISO 26146:2012, BS ISO 14802:2012 and ISO/CD 17224. Cranfield has investigated environmentally induced degradation (forms of hot corrosion and oxidation) for various materials systems (base alloys and metallic coatings) used in components (e.g., blades, vanes, discs and seals) of industrial gas turbines and jet engines. The drivers have been the need to improve efficiencies, reducing CO2 emissions and fuel use; to allow the use of new fuel sources; and to improve reliability by maintaining, or improving, component lives whilst using higher operating temperatures and fuels with higher levels of contaminants. This work has been aimed at improving the understanding of hot corrosion (high and low temperature) and oxidation in these systems [G2, 3, 5; P1-3, 5, 6]. Cranfield has investigated the relationships between the damage observed in different materials systems and the contaminants in the hot gas stream (from different sources and qualities of fuel and air), gas temperatures and pressures, component surface temperatures and deposits formed on surfaces. We optimised a methodology for assessing hot corrosion damage of materials [G2, 3, 5; P2, 6]. This involves the use of deposit re-coat testing combined with exposure in controlled-atmosphere furnaces. Samples are measured before and after exposure to quantify the distribution of damage in a statistically reliable method. One benefit of this method is it allows the effects of specific aspects of the exposure to be quantitatively linked to the materials damage found [P2, 6]. This enables the sensitivity of materials to changes in exposure conditions to be determined, and compared to the conditions/damage seen in operating systems. A further investigation explored the ability of alternative metallic coating compositions to resist particular degradation modes [G1, 4; P4]. This covered new developments for Al-Si diffusion coatings and MCrAlY sprayed coatings. In addition, research on protective coatings examined a new class of functionally graded metallic coatings that can resist multiple degradation modes [G4]. A third strand investigated the performance of existing and developmental metallic coatings/alloys in industrial gas turbines, in future power generation systems [G2, 5], [P1, 3, 5]. The need for new materials and changes to more realistic system configurations has been identified. For example, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems that use biomass/coal derived syngases (i.e., synthetic fuel gases), or hydrogen enriched syngases (e.g., for EU H2-IGCC project), to fire gas turbines, and gas turbines using oxy-fired natural gas (e.g., natural gas fired zero emission power plant, GAS-ZEP). Assessment of the exposure environments and operating conditions for components in these new power systems have been used as a basis for the experimental work. These activities have guided the development of power system concepts to optimise the balance between gas turbine operating conditions, gas cleaning system requirements, fuel specifications and component lives. * highest grade in period given Evidence of quality — peer-reviewed journal papers Key a Roll Royce plc, Elton Road, Derby, UK * 3 identified references that best indicate the quality of the research Further evidence of quality — underpinning research grants G1 EPSRC/TSB - SAMULET Project 1 - High Efficiency Turbomachinery (EP/G035369/1) — 2009-2013 — £957k — one of a series of university collaborative projects with Rolls Royce — Nicholls, Simms G2 EPSRC - SUPERGEN 2 - Conventional Power Plant Lifetime Extension Consortium — Phase 2 (EP/F029748/1) — 2008-2012 — total consortium grant £4.19m (four universities and 10 industrial companies, led by Loughborough University) — Cranfield grant £1.02m — Simms, Nicholls, Oakey G3 EPSRC - SUPERGEN 2 - Conventional Power Plant Lifetime Extension Consortium — Phase 1 (GR/S86334/01) — 2004-2008 — total consortium grant £2.11m (four universities and 11 industry partners) — Cranfield grant £559k — Simms, Nicholls, Oakey G4 TSB — Carbon Abatement Using Surface Engineering Technologies (CASET) (TP11/CAT6/I/BP103K) — 2010-2012 — total project value £1.6m (2 universities and 3 industrial partners) — Cranfield grant £349k — Simms, Nicholls G5 DTI / DECC - UK — US Collaborative Project on `Advanced Materials for Low Emission Power Plant' (Project C/07/00361/00/00) — Phase 1 — 2004-2009 — total UK project value £6.91m (2 universities and 5 industrial companies) — Cranfield grant £482k — Oakey, Simms Cranfield's research into materials degradation in industrial gas turbines has influenced materials selection, the standardisation of test methods, new coating systems and systems and fuel specification in power generation. Siemens, Rolls Royce and others have used our methods for selection of improved materials systems for particular applications [C2, C4, C5, C8, C10]. The selection of the best materials systems (coatings and base alloys) for components in jet engines and gas turbines improves their potential lives [C1, C6, C7]. High temperature oxidation and the various types of hot corrosion are critical issues for many components in turbine power systems e.g. blades, vanes, discs, and seals. In well-designed components, or with particular fuels/operating conditions, such degradation modes can limit component life. The damage can affect times between overhauls and risk of component failure. The deposit recoat test methodology for assessing corrosion in gas turbines developed at Cranfield was incorporated into an EU code of practice, and has become one of the recognised routes for assessing high temperature corrosion (draft ISO/CD 17224). This is one of the first ISO standards for high temperature corrosion and oxidation. Our dimensional metrology processes and methods for data analysis form parts of two other ISO standards issued in 2012 (BS ISO 26146:2012 and BS ISO 14802:2012, respectively. Rolls Royce and Siemens have adopted the methods as their standard approaches to assessing the performance of metallic gas turbine materials for these forms of damage. The consequence has been increased confidence in materials selection to resist degradation by hot corrosion [C8, 10]. Novel coating systems were developed for different specific environments, focused on meeting the needs of Rolls Royce [C6-8] and Siemens Industrial Turbo-machinery [C9, 10]. The work is of particular interest to jet engine and industrial gas turbine manufacturers, who need coatings that can be operated for longer and in more arduous conditions. Such developments involve increasingly complex coating systems applied in multiple stages, but are commercially sensitive [C6, 7]. Functionally graded coatings that are highly resistant to hot corrosion and oxidation were produced with Siemens and Praxair (Siemens was granted a patent with Cranfield co-authors) [C9, 10]. Guidance is being provided for the development of overall power system concepts to optimise the balance between gas turbine operating conditions, gas cleaning system requirements, fuel specifications and component lives. The advanced fossil fuel/biomass fired power systems that are under development (e.g., using gasification technologies) need to push the boundaries of materials performance in many respects with degradation due to creep, fatigue and corrosion/oxidation limiting both component lives and plant operating efficiencies. An example is a UK-US programme on quantifying the relationships between contaminant levels and materials damage from hot corrosion, with Siemens [C1 — C5]. These activities have identified materials systems to be used for gas turbine blades/vanes (and materials systems to be avoided) for viable component lives.

Two novel treatment technologies are currently      marketed. These technologies have raised international interest, resulting      in industrial development in Australia. UK Water companies have experienced difficulties in treating source      waters from peat moorland catchments since the 1990s. These sources      account for 30-40% of all the water used to produce drinking water in the      UK. The focus of the research has been on translating established      theoretical understanding to generate practical benefit that can be      applied in treatment works. The initial work was the first to identify and publish seasonal changes      in the flux and character of NOM leaching into source waters [G1, P1].      Critically, the work identified that existing indicators, such as water      colour, were inadequate in defining NOM load for treatment purposes.      Further industrially funded projects led to Cranfield becoming the first      university outside North America to be funded by the American Water Works      Association Research Foundation (now called the Water Research Foundation)      [G2]. The project produce a novel diagnostic toolkit - still used by both      researchers and water company practitioners - to fully characterise both      NOM in the source water and the resultant coagulated NOM aggregates      (flocs) formed during treatment [P2]. This, for the first time, enabled      the link between source water changes and treatability to be understood      and managed. Application of the toolkit led to discoveries which changed the      understanding of NOM removal in relation to treatability and optimisation      of coagulation. Traditional approaches involved empirical batch testing to      (re)establish the optimum dosing conditions. As a result of the work, it      is now possible for operators to monitor and change the effect of surface      charge on the coagulation process. Direct measurement of the particle      charge is used to optimise coagulation irrespective of the source water,      coagulant used, or pH level, without the need for empirical testing,      through a universal range of zeta potential values [P3]. In relation to treatability, we demonstrated that characterisation of the      organic matter within untreated raw water, by non-specific ion exchange      resins, can be used to identify both the likely coagulant demand and the      achievable residual dissolved organic matter concentration for optimised      dose conditions. These key findings have been used for assessment and deployment of new      technologies and in adapting existing systems to cope with changing      environmental conditions. Work examined the potential of a novel ion      exchange process for NOM removal. We established the beneficial impacts      provided by ion exchange processes, such as reducing disinfection      by-product formation (DBP) and increasing floc strength, and thereby      reducing downstream processing costs [G3, P4]. This underpinned a decision      by Yorkshire Water to invest in the technology for full-scale application      at three treatment sites. This was applied to other systems including algal laden reservoirs and      lowland water sources [G4]. Critically, and in conflict with conventional      thinking, the findings pertaining to peat based catchments were shown to      apply for all source waters. The work led to the discovery that sufficient      charge can be coated onto a bubble through surfactant and polymer      adsorption to obviate pre- coagulation of algae, a major limitation on      many operational sites, generating significant savings in energy and      operating costs (P5). At the disinfection stage of water treatment, pioneering work in DBP      formation at Cranfield led to the first published work identifying the      risk associated with emerging DBPs such as haloacetic acids (HAA) and      nitrogen based DBPs in the UK [G5]. A critical discovery was the absence      of a link between treatability and DBP formation, meaning that targeted      removal of high DBP forming compounds in not possible [P6]. Recent work      funded by the Scottish Government identified that switching to      chloramination is insufficient to minimise the risk of non compliance and      highlighted the need for integrated solutions.

Our toolkit developed through this work, for characterising organic      matter and flocs, is now routinely used by a number of UK water companies,      as evidenced from testimonials from Severn Trent Water [C1], United      Utilities [C2] and Yorkshire Water [C3]. The fundamental process      understanding underpins significant operational activity related to NOM      removal. Our work helped shape the operational policy relating to the scheduling      of the blending of water of different sources based on their      characterisation [C3]. The use of fractionation has been central to a      recent study looking at water intake contributions from different input      sources into two drinking water treatment works in the Yorkshire Water      region. The work on the role of zeta potential as a universal guide to      optimisation of coagulation now forms the basis of routine monitoring in      operating the largest drinking water works within the Severn Trent region      [C1]. The research findings have been embedded into operational practice      and have resulted in significant savings in chemicals and energy      consumption. Scottish Water recently adopted the combination of both sets      of techniques as standard tests as part of a detailed investigation      programme of its existing coagulation sites for process optimisation,      works audits and to guide investment decisions [C4]. Additionally, United      Utilities now routinely uses the tools as part of their coagulation      diagnostics in relation to problematic operational sites [C2] The diagnostic tools have also been central to the assessment of new      technologies, such as novel magnetic ion exchange processes. This work      informed Yorkshire Water's decision in 2009 to invest £50M in the      technology at three drinking water treatment sites, including the first      example of the technology to be implemented in Europe. More recent work      has been utilised by the water companies to assess a number of other      technologies such as nanofiltration, electro coagulation and novel      adsorbents where the tools and approaches developed by Cranfield are used      to understand the potential of the technoloy and shape future      investment plans [C1, C3]. The application of the tools is being developed through industrially      funded projects related to catchment management [C5] so that the impact of      the research in terms of the drinking water treatment works can be      properly understood [C1, C3]. These projects represent some of the first      examples of such an approach: the findings of these studies are changing      the water companies' understanding of catchment management and shaping      future policy [C1]. The team's research has resulted in two novel technologies, marketed by      Water Innovate limited, part of the Bluewater Bio group [C6]. - The first is PosiDAF®, a novel adaption of the dissolved air flotation      process that utilises positively charged bubbles by coating them with      either surfactants or polymers. In Australia, there is a demonstration of      the potential for Cranfield's invention for algae removal from both      drinking water sources and final effluent lagoons for wastewater      treatment. The work has industrial support from five water companies and      the Australian Research council [C7]. Cranfield continues to collaborate      through a transfer of staff to the University of New South Wales. - The second technology is the membrane chemical reactor (MC-RTM).      This is a photocatalytic reactor linked to a membrane to ensure the      containment and reuse of nano    particulate titanium dioxide catalyst particles. The technology, patented in    2005 [C8], is under further development as part of a programme of work    funded by Severn Trent Water for the removal of a recalcitrant pesticide    (metaldehyde) from river waters. Funding has now been secured for a    demonstration of a photocatalytic pilot plant to refine the business case a    full-scale version of the technology in the next asset investment plan [C9]. Our work has helped to shape investment programmes, and assist utilities      in meeting future risks from new legislation related DBPs that are      currently unregulated such as haloacetic acids. Work for the Scottish      Government on use of alternative disinfectants led to a report published      by the water quality regulator for Scotland that has influenced policy on      water compliance for Scotland [C10]. The work on emerging DBPs was funded by a consortium of UK water      companies to understand the risks. C1. Contact: Senior Process Scientist, Severn Trent Water, Coventry, UK C2.

Decision-support tools were developed for risk management andenvironmental rehabilitation of contaminated sites. The tools contribute to end-user confidence inremediation technology, reduced remediation costs and minimised waste disposal to landfill withsubsequent savings in CO2 emissions. Our research laid a road map to demonstrate risk reductionand provided practical and cost efficient soil quality management tools. The focus of our research has been to tackle the protection and recovery of soils contaminated bycomplex hydrocarbon mixtures, a key challenge for industrialised countries, because of itsconsequences for water resources and land use [G1,2,5,6]. Our research draws on Cranfield'sanalytical and environmental modelling expertise with a substantive contribution to the practice ofsustainable remediation. We have pioneered the detailed chemical examination of heavy oil residues by reference to riskconcepts, dramatically improving on the rudimentary analytical parameters used in riskassessment in the mid 1990's. Early work secured novel analytical insights on gaschromatography to characterise complex weathered contaminated soil-oil matrices and allowed thedevelopment of new analytical indices of biotransformation. This set the theoretical groundwork foran industrial research consortium addressing the risk-based bioremediation of weatheredhydrocarbon waste in 2004 [G5]. This enabled us to construct innovative decision-support tools forcontaminated sites such as the Remediation Decision Support Tool for stakeholders (BP, Shell,National Grid) [G5] and service providers (Remedios Ltd) [P3,G5] and the fugacity1 basedmultimedia fate and transport tool [C1,2,G3,4,5]. Specifically, we addressed the partitioning of complex hydrocarbon mixtures within the soil-oilmatrix of contaminated soils using authentic wastes and we characterised the fate and transport ofthe contaminants in question, a key requirement for estimating risks to human health and theenvironment [P1,3]. We also quantified the biotransformation half-lives in the residual oil phase[P2,4,6]. These are rarely, if ever, measured or even predicted [P2], and overly-conservativeestimates had been resulting in over- stringent soil assessment criteria with considerable costimplications for remediation - a waste of resource and a missed opportunity to recover land quality[C2]. Our research corrected this and has the potential to save between £3.2 million and £12.4million per year in remediating derelict land for development in the UK [C1,3,4]. It further provideda `fit for purpose' assessment of the fate of hydrocarbon complex mixtures and risk-criticalcompounds in soils allowing realistic remediation objectives to be set [P2] supporting swifter, risk-based remediation. The detailed evaluation of different hydrocarbon fractions has further helped the appraisal ofresidual hydrocarbon levels that can be left safely at remediated sites without posing unacceptablerisk [P2,5]. This ensures environmental protection and the recovery of soil quality for reuse[P1,3,6]. Our work and reputation in this area have led to contributions on environmental decision-making ingeneral, better regulation and risk policy via drafting the national consultation and regulatoryguidance on the assessment of risks from hydrocarbon-contaminated soils for the EnvironmentAgency of England and Wales in 2005 [G2, C1]. * highest grade in period given Evidence of quality - Peer reviewed journal papers P1 Wu G. e, Kechavarzi C., Li X. e, Sui H. e, Pollard S.J.T., Coulon F.(2012).

We have created a roadmap for risk reduction and promoted soilremediation, and made the methods widely available through commercially available toolkits. Our work has improved the technical capability of our industrial partner Eurofins EGS (formerlyTES Bretby). The company grew by 70% during the later stages of this project following the awardof the 2012 Olympics Park testing contract in London. The company is confident to have achievedthe objective of 2% increased analytical sales. The company estimated an overall of £200k perannum saving on their hydrocarbon analysis costs including: (i) reduced use of solvents, saving£100k per annum, (especially due to reduced use of chlorinated solvents by 90%); (ii) improvedlaboratory throughput (4 fold faster than using previous methods): £80k per annum on-goingsaving) and; (iii) reduced quality control failures by either incomplete extraction of surrogates orcross contamination (Estimate £20k per annum on-going saving) [C5]. The UK Standing Committee of Analysts `Blue book 2012' of accredited analytical methods forpetroleum hydrocarbons now includes the analytical method [P5] developed under the BBSRCBioremediation Link programme 2004-2008 [G5]. This addresses ISO17025 for TPH analysis,banding and class separation, and complies with the Environment Agency's MonitoringCertification Scheme (mCERTs)). Our research laid out a road map of the logical steps involved in the demonstration of riskreduction within process-optimised technology and provided a set of practical and cost efficient soilquality management tools in 2008 [C1,3,4]. As with many large companies, BP International [G5],Shell UK [G4] or NationalGrid [G3] (our industrial partners) engage a range of consultants to carryout site investigations, design remedial strategies and to carry them out. However there has been alack of continuity in strategy and transparency except when single contractor has worked onnumerous sites, which the roadmap has addressed. By promoting a greater understanding of theremediation technologies, both internally and externally, we have aided strategic decisions of ourindustrial partner, Remedios Ltd [C1] on their future direction in terms of the ex-situ remediationmarket in 2009 [P3]. Our application of fugacity-based multimedia models [P2, 4 & 6] for predicting the phasedistribution and concentrations of organic contaminants during remediation treatment has beenused to address the key issues of identifying the source of risk, the perception of risk and theappropriate societal response to this problem [C1,2]. Particularly our combined hazard and riskdiagnostic strategy approach demonstrated that information obtained could meaningfully be usedto assess constraints of bioremediation and most significantly help to avoid unnecessaryexpenditure [C1,2,4]. Our research led to a decision-support tool kit with our industrial partner Remedios Ltd in 2008 [P3;C1]. The tool kit was initially designed for sites contaminated with weathered hydrocarbonsfocusing on sites characterisation and risk-based approach where biopiling and/or turned windrowswere proposed as a treatment option. Cranfield broadened the tool kit to all remediationtechnologies for contaminated lands and waters with the perspectives of facilitating and assisting ina transparent decision making process. The tool is available at:http://www.abdn.ac.uk/remediation-dst/. Our technical contribution has been published via CL:AIRE website in 2010 which ensured (i) atargeted delivery to ca. 4500 contaminated land practitioners and advisors, (ii) effective knowledgetransfer to the remediation and consulting community [C3,6].

Cranfield's research in compressible turbulent flow for Low Mach numbers      is now employed to increase accuracy in CFD codes employed by the German      Aerospace Agency DLR, Pennsylvania State University, and the French      Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, which use this work to model flows      ranging from turbulent mixing through inertial confinement fusion (ICF) to      scramjets. Now that it is no longer possible to conduct live tests of nuclear      weapons, accurate computer modelling is essential to underwrite their      safety and performance. Modelling to understand instabilities and      turbulent mixing at material interfaces is an area that demands better      understanding. Cranfield's work on CFD (2004 to date) concerns: The research is motivated by a range of diverse applications in science      and engineering, including: inertial confinement fusion (ICF); micro and      nanocrystalline materials and interfacial friction in materials; nuclear      energy; detonation; supersonic combustion; and astrophysics. In ICF, the main area of application of the research, the dense shell,      filled with deuterium-tritium (DT) gas, implodes when irradiated by laser      beams or by other means. When a shock wave refracts through the shell-fuel      interface, the boundary experiences Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI).      RMI leads to the growth of perturbations on the shell-fuel interface and      causes turbulent mixing of the materials. Rayleigh-Taylor instability      (RTI) and mixing also occurs at the shell-fuel interface towards the end      of the implosion phase, when the less dense gas decelerates the shell. RMI      and RTI turbulent mixing reduce the heating of the gas during the      implosion phase and inhibit the thermonuclear reaction after ignition,      degrading the performance of the ICF target. Accurate modelling of RMI and      RTI is a major uncertainty in calculating how an ICF target will behave. In the framework of the present research, Cranfield developed new      high-resolution and high-order computational methods that improve the      accuracy in compressible turbulent mixing simulations [P1, P2, P3]. The      results from the simulation and modelling studies were validated against      specially designed experiments performed at AWE, as well as simulation and      modelling data using AWE's industrial codes. Cranfield investigated the      influence of the initial conditions on RMI, RTI and turbulent mixing in a      range of ICF mixing problems. In the course of the research [P4, P5], Cranfield also developed      multi-scale models that couple continuum and molecular dynamics methods in      order to study dynamic friction between material interfaces. Friction at      the interface between dissimilar metallic components as a result of high      velocity impact or explosive loading can have a profound effect on the      subsequent motion. A comprehensive understanding of the processes involved      across a wide range of initial conditions is still not available. This      research revealed the growth of epitaxial layers of the softer material,      shifting of the sliding interface due to formation of shear-bands,      development of amorphous structures, and ultimately the resultant motion      of the components. Analysis of the results also linked these processes to      the changes in the state of the material through growth of dislocations      and thermal effects [P5]. The research enhanced our understanding in compressible turbulent mixing      and dynamic friction, which are core activities of AWE's technical      programme.

PI: Prof Drikakis Due to the nature of AWE's work, focused on nuclear weapons, national        security makes it impossible to provide accessible published evidence of        the impact of Cranfield's research. What we can provide, detailed below,        is an explanation of the context in which the work has been applied, and        quotes from senior individuals at AWE, attesting to the impact of this        research on their work. Accurate computer modelling is needed to underwrite the safety and      performance of nuclear weapons. Instabilities and turbulent mixing at      material interfaces is one area where better understanding is essential      [C1]. A decade ago, the type of ""Large Eddy Simulation"" used at AWE to      gain a fundamental understanding of the mixing processes was much      criticised by the academic community with respect to its ability to      capture accurately the correct turbulent-flow physics. The numerical methods developed at Cranfield University have been used by      AWE to investigate the influence of initial conditions of mixing due to      Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. Turbulence modelling simulations often      ignore the influence of initial conditions on turbulent mixing, so      Cranfield's work has a substantial impact in reducing computational      uncertainty in turbulent mixing predictions and is now taken into account      in AWE's modelling. ""The collaboration between AWE and Cranfield University, which has        involved simulation methods at both institutions and experiments at AWE,        has led to a high degree of confidence in the computer modelling we now        use to understand turbulent mixing."" [C2, C4] The methods developed at Cranfield have also been used for 3D simulation      of complex flows where mixing is on average two-dimensional. These results      have led to a substantial advance with respect to validation and      verification of computational models by improving the accuracy of      engineering turbulence models (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes models)      used in ICF applications at AWE. During the course of this research, a key improvement was made by      Cranfield to the Godunov methods used at Cranfield to simulate      compressible turbulent flow, in particular the behaviour at low Mach      number. This improvement significantly increases the accuracy of      computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes in turbulent flow simulations.      Furthermore, it enhances the efficiency of CFD codes because high accuracy      can be attained even with low numerical grid resolution, thus leading to      shorter computing times. Low-Mach corrections developed at Cranfield — as well as variants of      Cranfield's work produced by other research groups — are now employed in      CFD codes in the German Aerospace Agency DLR [C5], Pennsylvania State      University [C6] and the French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique [C7].      These organisations use these CFD codes for flows ranging from turbulence      mixing through to scramjets. Cranfield's work has inspired further developments in the international      research community, eg, the French nuclear hydraulics code FLICA-OVAP and      at Tsinghua (China) in relation to turbine blades A related area of      physics that is also of concern to AWE is dynamic friction at material      interfaces under extreme conditions of velocity and normal stress. AWE's      previous modelling using continuum hydrocodes, and work at the US Los      Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) using molecular dynamics simulations,      had produced conflicting predictions of behaviours in this regime. AWE      resolved this by adopting Cranfield's approach and has incorporated this      in model development. ""Research performed by Professor Drikakis' group led to the        development of a hybrid method in which continuum and molecular dynamics        codes were directly coupled. This approach has helped to reconcile        apparent contradictions in the earlier work, and has provided new        insights that will inform future model development at AWE.""
